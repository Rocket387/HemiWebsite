            50 Years Living with a Hemi an Invisible and Seemingly Unknown Visible Impairment
            as seen through Hemi Why and Who?
            <br>
            Hemi Technicals, Hemi Practice into Theory, to Explain or not to Explain? and Hemi Challenge, inspired by Paradise Lost 1 and 2 and Beyond the Scan,

        </p>
  
           <p> Paradise Lost 1 - Billion to One Against for Real </p>
            <br>
           <p> Hemi Hello,
            <br>
            <br>
            In case we haven’t met before, a very warm welcome. If we have, a very warm welcome back.  
            I’m a right homonymous hemianopia, inevitably hemi for short. My name means he’s only half his vision, 
            all based on his left side in both half-eyes. That’s along with a tiny bit on my right hemi blank side 
            - I’m not rectangular, nor am I visible. “Him” is the poor unfortunate landed with me. 
            </p>
            <p>
            To be yet more hemi confusing, although I have half-eyes his short-vision sees not much more than quarter-eyes, 
            often less, his long-vision close to three-quarter-eyes, sometimes more.  
            Fortunately, that’s all in the hemi main story and a great deal more, including 300 hemi images. 
            Fortunately again, here in Paradise Lost 1 his short-vision won’t be getting involved.  
            Paradise Lost 2 is the hemi horror story when fate returns 42 years later to finish the job after letting him off here. 
            Between the two Paradise Losts Beyond the Scan, a medical condition that, according to a scan, doesn’t exist.   
            Not that any of this matters for the moment as I still don’t exist and he has to go off to the South Pacific to meet me. 
            It may seem odd for him not to have taken a camera. Though by now any hemi images would be tired and brown, 
            while the “timelessness” he knew was bright and clear. And a camera would have interfered in a world that was still hardly disturbed. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Paradise Lost 1’s Two Worlds 
            <br>
            Paradise Lost 1 is about two entirely separate worlds, so separate there’s no point in attempting to compare. 
            When in one, it was as if the other didn’t exist. And while one had so little it’s easy to remember, the other so much it’s easy to forgot. 
            Except here in Paradise Lost 1 he was switched in a moment from “timelessness” to a hospital ward in “somewhere else” with nothing in between, 
            meaning “timelessness” was still complete within itself, while “somewhere else” was almost empty.  
            <br> 
            This hemi story follows three journeys, to Ugi in “timelessness” and to two major hospitals in “somewhere else” and the time spent between them. 
            The journeys include 16 mini-stopovers. There was an additional journey that his mind blanked for a reason fully understandable when he gets there.    
            So, as I still don’t exist, I’m handing over to him. See you again as his brain blows.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Journey 1 - London to Ugi 
            If you ever went to “timelessness”, the better the journey would have become. 
            <br>
            London to Nandi in Fiji 
            <br>
            I followed the sun – New York in mid-afternoon London grey-gloom, San Francisco in its picture postcard golden sunset, 
            midnight in Honolulu with the entire city out on the street, dawn in Nandi with a day and a night of everydayness away from Fiji’s commercial paradise.
            <br>
            Fiji to Honiara, Capital of the Solomon Islands 
            On to Port Vila on Vanuatu for another re-fuelling, along the way discarding plastic airline food and cutlery for the local real thing. 
            And discarding a jet with empty windows for a turbo-prop with windows full of the ocean and occasionally specks of land.   
            Vanuatu at the time was still the mouth filling Condominium of the New Hebrides, 
            with France and the UK taking their historic engagement to the other end of the world. 
            Probably a 1 – 1 draw as they were both playing away.  
            Back again above the empty ocean and on to Honiara.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Honiara
            <br>
            Honiara’s on Guadalcanal, the main and most central island of the Solomons. 
            Putting it awkwardly, it’s someway to the right of a line between Papua New Guinea and Australia, with Papua New Guinea the closer of the two.  
            The Solomons is a nation of islands and atolls, 13 islands inhabited. 
            It stretches for nearly 1,000 miles with a population of not much more than 500,000. 
            The vast remoteness is presumably the reason why it has, or had, 71 languages or dialects uneasily held together by pidgin English banned at schools in the interest of English.  
            Honiara was more like an extended village than a town - a few shops, two banks covering the vast emptiness, a hotel, a cinema, 
            churches and a Government building completely incongruous against everything else – brick and first floor against single story and corrugated iron or traditional thatch. 
            At the time, the U.K. was still responsible for the country in a leisurely way. 
            All around was piercing light and silence, what sound there was as clear as the light. 
            The heat? Hot, though just about manageable. Traffic? Almost none, with only 30 miles of tarmac. 
            Sadly, the Solomons then was probably still best remembered as its significance in the Second World War. 
            Honiara and Henderson Airdrome in particular were the final obstacles on the way to Australia. 
            Evidence remained of what had happened – markers of battle positions, Lark Sound renamed Iron Bottom Sound, swimming still forbidden, 
            such local artefacts as old shells now used as cooking pots.  
            <br>
            Why Was I There?
            I was waiting for “the Badley” nearly a week away. It was one of the two workhorses – the other “the Selwyn” - of the Melanesian Mission and I was to be one of its teachers. 
            I’d applied as a volunteer to work anywhere in urban Africa without realising the volunteer agencies of the time had divided the world between themselves in a way that excluded my continent of preference.  
            Instead, a four line letter informed me that I was best suited for the Solomons as a teacher, though I wasn’t one and had asked not to be used that way. 
            No criticism of teachers and teaching implied, rather a questioning of my own suitability. 
            The various missionary societies on the islands were responsible for providing all the still limited education available on behalf of the Government. 
            That was except for the latter’s recent full level secondary school in Honiara, the first in the islands. 
            I had been allocated to Alangaula Senior Primary School on Ugi. 
            Education, like so often elsewhere, was recognised by parents as the only way ahead for their children, though there was no guarantee of a job at the end or even progress to secondary school. 
            And education wasn’t free, more or less a pittance elsewhere yet not in a country still on the edge of a cash economy.
            There was an additional cost to parents. Students at Alangaula would be away from home for three of their teenage years, anything between 10 and 18. 
            It meant they would be unavailable to work in the family gardens, instead responsible for looking after themselves.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Honiara to Ugi
            <br>
            Workhorse was a reasonable description of “the Badley” and “the Selwyn” as they carried everyone and everything, 
            could more or less steer themselves across the empty ocean, and their speed not much faster than their solid ground counterparts. 
            Their size? Probably not much more than some London tourist launches.
            Once on board, the vastness of the ocean repeated his experience flying above it. 
            And how slow “the Badley” was as it hugged the shoreline of Makira, the long thin main island of the Eastern Solomons. 
            Hour after hour there was nothing to be seen other than forest down to the shoreline on one side, the empty ocean on the other, the forest disappearing up onto the highlands above. 
            Just once was there a cluster of huts in a tiny break in the shoreline, “the Badley” appearing unable to pass. 
            Why should anyone think to live in such utter isolation? Or rather, what a ridiculous question to ask. I had a great deal to learn. 
            Dusk arrived with its rapid transition from day to dark, a South Pacific dark that was almost always easily visible. 
            “The Badley” anchored, though it didn’t mean I’d arrived, only to stay the night at the sister school to the one I was still heading for – education wasn’t restricted to young men. 
            <br>
            The next morning a continuation of the forest shoreline till Kira Kira, the village capital of Makira and the Eastern Solomons. 
            Then “the Badley” cut across the - as always - empty ocean to Ugi, a 6 by 2 miles coral extension of Makira, and to Alanguala. 
            How long had I spent on “the Badley”? Much the same as I’d spent crossing the rest of the world.
            “The Badley” had anchored in a small bay that provided a welcoming break in the forest shoreline, the only protection for small boats like “the Badley” for goodness knows how far. 
            I could see a line of students at the shore’s edge waiting. By the time I’d waded ashore a few moments later, those along the forest shoreline appeared to have already disappeared. 
            </p>
            
            <p>            
            Main Stopover 1 – “Timelessness”
            <br>
            “Timelessness” 
            Looking out at the horizon from what had become my tiny home a stone’s throw from the shore – to the left, a small slice of Makira, 
            sometimes within welcoming reach, others distant and foreboding leaving Ugi entirely out on its own; ahead, a vast swathe of the empty ocean, 
            lmost silent unless in anger; to the right, the bay and beyond the headland that formed it. 
            Close up, forest shoreland left and right with the welcoming sandy beach in between.
            <br>
            Turning inland - the school a continuation of the beach and on to some of the students’ “bush set” homes, with forest left and right before winding up to Ugi’s highlands.  
            Dominant was silence. The forest helped to muffle the school like it did everything else. 
            The silence was aided by the school having no electricity other than enough to light evening classes. 
            Noise was formed only by voices. Not even doors being slammed as there were no doors, naturally no windows as well. 
            A bit risky? There was as good as nothing to lose. A very light jacket of mine was shared around as normal practice and I wondered who would be wearing it next. 
            My only warning of anything in advance had been not to express too much interest in anything for fear of being given it.  
            Sound of transport? An occasional islander silently walking along the forest track, islanders silently fishing in their canoes, 
            sometimes nothing more for a month or so till “the Badley” or “the Selwyn” looked in again.
            Animals and birds? Almost no evidence. Geckos croaking at night. 
            Evidence of megapodes with their eggs hatched by the heat of the sand. Plenty of flies. 
            The exception to the silence was the gentle breeze that drifted in just as the heat was becoming unbearable. 
            It was completely reliable other than during the hurricane season. Breeze, never wind, and it always disappeared at dusk with its day’s work done.
            The silence of the forest and the ocean blended with the sun, the moon and the stars, the latter two close enough to be good friends. 
            It was instinctive to look up at night. The world had become vertical, or rather circular, a globe of its own to which I was now a part. 
            There was a completeness, my respect for “timelessness” perhaps not unlike that of the islanders who’d never known anything else.
            </p>
           
            <p>
            Ugi  
            <br>
            After its first recorded sighting, Ugi’s islanders were left alone for several hundred years. 
            pparently, the islanders of the time had made it clear visitors weren’t welcome.  
            The terrain must have helped, as was still the case. So small, yet a heavy journey across, a challenge along. 
            Just the schools – a two years secondary school half an hour or so away from Alangaula – had been added. 
            The island population was said to be 200 islanders living in four scattered villages, though the village close to Alangaula, like the one I passed on Makira, was smaller. 
            Villagers eked out a subsistence living from gardens scratched out of the highlands’ coral. Taro, cassava, perhaps more recently sweet potato. 
            Crops grew fast, so did weeds, and before a crop was harvested another garden had to have been prepared, most likely some distance away.
            The school had its own gardens, pau-pau, breadfruit and limes as well, plus a very small amount of a green vegetable locally called Chinese cabbage. 
            Only in abundance were coconuts and fish, the fish caught using a spear along the shoreline at night, using a canoe during the day. 
            There seemed only one form of economic activity on, or rather close by, besides teaching – all the other six teachers at Alangaula were islanders, 
            one from Ugi itself - and occasionally a Chinese boat serving as a corner store. 
            From time to time one of the workhorses would turn up to take a group of men to Pio, an uninhabited 2 miles by 1 island extension of Ugi, to smelt copra, a by-product of the island’s never-ending coconut supply.
            <br>
            Alanguala
            <br>
            The school might have been parachuted in and kept ready to be parachuted away if required, or more likely to disappear under the foliage if for some reason abandoned. 
            It was self-contained except for some basic supplies delivered by the workhorses.
            There were 120 students, two classes each for levels 5 to 7, six wooden classrooms, the head teacher’s house, a chapel, a general hall or dining room, a kind of kitchen, 
            six tiny homes for the teachers and the “bush-sets” where the students lived and cared for themselves arranged in their island groupings.  
            That was except during weekdays in term time when the students ate together, a homemade bread for breakfast and alternatively rice and sweet potato with coconut milk and Chinese cabbage at midday. 
            The school uniform was light brown shorts and shirts that blended perfectly with the surroundings.
            There was morning and evening school. Part of the afternoon was spent by the students on the school’s gardens, or on general maintenance which included keeping the weeds at bay. 
            The school was kept meticulously clean and tidy like everything else, not that there was any problem with litter as there was nothing to cause it.
            Teaching facilities were the absolute minimum, here a chart of the body, there a history of the islands in 40 small pages. 
            Despite, students learned and the school regularly came top among the senior primary schools across the islands sitting the Cambridge Overseas Certificate.
            The school appeared to have no disciplinary problems despite traditional inter-island disputes. This must have been aided by the status of the headteacher, 
            the first islander headteacher who went on to become the first islander Archbishop of the South Pacific.  
            It was a hard life for the students, though nothing new to them. And there was always enough energy left for football. 
            The lead goalkeeper had a polio leg as well as being one of the school’s best swimmers. Disability discrimination hadn’t arrived. Hopefully, it still hasn’t.

            Gentle Beginning of the End
            <br>
            Only fate knows why I got a brain abscess. It happened, so there was no point in trying to find out why. 
            Though perhaps his lifestyle had played a part, the hurricane as well.										
            I was conscious of my diet, never hungry yet what was immediately available was highly restricted. 
            No fridge or freezer, only a very limited supply of anything fresh. I shopped by sending an order via one of the workhorses to a store in Honiara and waited for my order to be delivered the same way, a turnaround of a month or so. 
            The basic midday meal I shared with the students.  
            I’d always been physically fit. It was assumed I’d rest from the sun in the early afternoon like the other teachers. 
            Instead, I joined the students I’d come to be with and was the regular football referee. Hard, yet nothing unreasonable. The sun? Hot, yet the breeze was at work as well.   
            Then the small boil in my left armpit. I’d never had a boil before. It was worrying in a hot and sweaty setting. My medical supply from “somewhere else” was paracetamol and antiseptic cream. 
            Plenty of the latter and the boil amazingly disappeared, far faster than I’m imagined. An immense relief, yet so sudden? Not something to be forgotten. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The Hurricane
            <br>
            Apparently, the hurricane was the most powerful on record for that part of the South Pacific. It behaved as expected, the wind howling in one direction, having a rest, then howling back again with trees horizontal the other way.  
            I sat in my home as the hurricane performed. Then at half time a student ran passed telling me to leave as the tree close by might fall on it. 
            It was nearly dark by then as I joined students and other teachers with their families in one of the classrooms beyond the reach of any immediate danger. 
            Then a message came through of some form of difficulty in the village not far away - I passed it daily on my way to the freshest of fresh waterfall showers that could ever be imagined. 
            No one moved, though I’d assumed no one would expect the outsider to get involved. 
            It was exhilarating running through the forest with a small group of students following. The forest was never dense, and darkness in “timelessness” was never pitch even during a hurricane. 
            A vast tree had already fallen across the track and there were fallen branches everywhere. I was reassured by the story that no one had ever been killed by a flying coconut. I had no sense of danger. 
            We came to the stream I crossed on my way to the waterfall. It wasn’t just that the plank bridge had gone. It was the stream as well. In its place a furious torrent. 
            It was lucky I knew how to canoe. Throw myself in and swim frantically directly across would have swept me on to the ocean. 
            Throw myself in and swim frantically upstream with a slight twitch to the opposite bank and I might make it.   
            I never discovered what the difficulty had been at the village. The villagers had already gone. I found some of them in the classroom on our return. 
            They’d used another track, the one we’d just used as well. The islanders’ faces showed the immense respect they had for the elements that controlled their lives just like their forebears, the students too.  
            Dawn was arriving as the wind eased. The roof of one of the classrooms was down, there was debris everywhere, yet no harm had been done to anyone. Priority? Clear the football pitch.  
            Life continued as usual, though there was extra work to be done by way of clearing and replanting. The debris to be cleared included the pau-pau and breadfruit trees. A sudden glut, then none for several months till new ones had had a chance to grow.
            </p>

            My Friendly Headache
            <br>
            It was two or three weeks after the hurricane that my friendly headache arrived. It was waiting for me first thing one morning, as gentle as the breeze.  
            Something odd to be found in “timelessness” where tension was unknown. Except my friendly headache wasn’t like the headaches of “somewhere else”. 
            It hardly hurt and was so considerate, sometimes just above my eyes, then at the back of my head, occasionally on top.  
            So helpful it made me feel guilty dismissing it with two paracetamols that shouldn’t have been allowed. I was letting “timelessness” down. 
            Yet my friendly headache never took offence. It returned in the evening, again in the morning, again and again.   
            My friendly headache wasn’t alarming. Strange it had come, stranger it kept returning, yet nothing more. It was doing no harm and, like the antiseptic cream, I had a good paracetamol supply. 
            I hadn’t had to take any before. Anyway, the headache would soon be gone like the boil.  
            Except it didn’t. Two weeks or so later my friendly headache started to change, increasingly disturbing. It was a Friday. I’d planned to cross the island next morning and had to think again. Never mind. 
            Another time. Instead, I spent the time with the students of one of the “bush-sets”, the one closest to my home.  
            Things were worse on Monday morning. I felt cold. It was like after it rained, except it hadn’t. I even found the clothes I’d worn during my journey, a bit warmer than the others. 
            By now my friendly headache wasn’t friendly. I had a temperature hot and cold. Though most likely it was good news. At last, whatever was going on inside was coming to a head. 
            Sweat it out overnight and that would be that.

            Except it wasn’t. Instead, his brain blew – and most likely blew me in at the same time so I’ve taken over.                                                
            He’d been asleep as intended, yet not for long. It was 9.50pm on Monday 10th February 1969. 
            And already he was out of bed, out of his home, running in the forest, running in a frenzied attempt to get ahead of the pain even if only for the tiniest fraction of a moment.  
            Inevitably, he failed. Yet he kept on trying, kept on running. There was no alternative. He’d nothing else to try.
            The pain was brutally overwhelming, his fingers screaming at his head. He’d never imagined pain like it. It wouldn’t let go, trying to break into his skull. 
            So, he kept running, running ridiculously. Though the thought of being so ridiculous just perhaps lessened the pain even if only for the tiniest fraction of a moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
            He was back at his home with his paracetamols. How many pills could he take every day, eight or was it 16? The pain was already bending his mind. 
            Then on top of it he remembered the frightening gap when he wouldn’t be allowed any more till the following day. Though he hadn’t even started. 
            Not that it mattered. His two paracetamols returned even faster than he’d swallowed them, now coated in lime tasted vomit – limes were the only fresh fruit still available. 
            He tried again with the same result. Water on its own performed the same way. There was no point in trying again. The vomiting continued till his supply ran out.  
            The pain made him think of earthquakes. His headache exceeded the 10 points maximum on the Richter earthquake scale. 
            Though thinking the thought also eased the pain even if only for another tiniest fraction of a moment like when he thought of the ridiculousness of his running. 
            Then he remembered the expression “not giving something even to his worst enemy”. He didn’t have any worst enemy, yet again thinking the thought gave him the same tiniest fraction of relief. 
            Except he’d already run out of pain restricting expressions. Best go back to earthquakes and try to remember as many of them as he could.   
            He went back to bed and hid his head under the bedclothes, or rather single sheet, the pillow on top. It made no difference, or rather worse. 
            Except somehow he’d got his feet higher than his head as he struggled with the mosquito net, and the pain eased just a tiny bit more and a tiny bit longer. Then he was back into the forest running. 
            The mosquito net was now meaningless. His pain was so bad it couldn’t get any worse.
            <br>
            By now he was exhausted. His running had been absurd. So, what to do? 
            <br>
            Perhaps call someone? Yet to where and who? There was no phone, only a radio link at 4.00pm every afternoon at the secondary school to the mainland - wherever that might be. 
            Call someone here at the school? That would wake everyone up. Go and find someone? Yet who and why? It was now 1.00am, halfway through the “timelessness” night. And what could anyone do for him?
            It was ridiculous again. He’d come all this way to try to be useful, only to end up running around in the middle of the night looking for sympathy for himself – and for nothing more than a bad headache. Watch out. 
            He was massively exaggerating, perhaps exaggerating as he was so far away? 
            The question was dangerous. It helped him to pull himself together. Face reality. There was nothing he or anyone else could do till morning and by then his headache would have gone. 
            Imagine his embarrassment, his shame, if he kept on making such a fuss?
            </p>

            <p>
            Pain v. Refrain
            <br>
            Except the pain, unlike the hurricane, kept howling, with sleep out of the question. Also out of the question was trying to teach in the morning. 
            For a moment his failure added to the pain, though only a moment. The pain was too intense to think anything beyond.  
            Then a thought was beginning to form, not completely unlike the breeze. The breeze could never assuage the heat, yet hold it back just enough to make things manageable. 
            Now a kind of pain refrain, though in no way effective unlike the breeze, not at all. However, by continually working on it he had something else for his mind to think about besides the pain.   
            The pain refrain was in three parts. The first two arrived almost together, the third a little later when the other two started to struggle. 
            And as his inability to sleep continued for five days and nights, he had to keep working at the refrain all the time. 
            First, however painful the pain might be, he couldn’t be ill. A bad headache yes, even in “timelessness”, though nothing more. 
            He went through his childhood illnesses and inoculations. Non-smoker, only an occasional drink, canoeing champion, just about as good a specimen of healthiness as could be found.  
            And sick of what? He was aware that cancer could strike young people as well as later and there were some ghastly illnesses and disabilities reserved for children. 
            Though that was absurd in “timelessness” and he withdrew the thought.  
            The refrain moved on and said it all – Ugi, “timelessness”, it was where he was, where he wanted to be, by then there was nothing else. Lying in his bed he could see the forest, the ocean, the sky day and night, both in his mind and for real. 
            Finally, what began to take over as the pain refused to go, not even ease? He had no sense of what might happen next. Manyana! What would be would be, and without any expectation of anything, perhaps not unlike for the islanders. 
            Just once he imagined an ambulance, then immediately it disappeared, not even a thought of a hospital.
            The impossible was being taken away. Imagine the disgrace as well as the shame. Would they ever let him back when he recovered a few days later, perhaps even by the time he got to wherever they might send him? 
            Yet even worse if that was possible, he remembered he was being paid, him a volunteer. The Solomons still had no university graduates of its own, and he was told he would be debasing the graduate currency if he refused. 
            “Volunteer” meant nothing. And look at him now?
            The refrain had a performance of its own. It had to be followed in order. A long pause always required a return to the start. 
            Which was a kind of relief as the beginning was less disturbing than the end.   
            He hid in his home during the day, too ashamed to be seen. Night-time was easier, the forest again. A student who’d followed him into the forest in the hurricane insisted in staying with him for his protection, sleeping the sleep of the just on the floor of his other room. 
            It meant he had to take immense care to avoid the student when he went in and out of his home. He still wasn’t aware that I’d almost certainly arrived to add to the risk of hemi bumping.

            The Headteacher and the Stranger
            <br>
            Next afternoon the headteacher of the secondary school came to see him. Clearly, someone had followed the forest track to report that something had happened, the headteacher then coming to assess whether or not it should be reported to the mainland.   
            He doesn’t remember the conversation. More significant to him was that the headteacher had brought some equipment from the family medical supply to give him an injection. The injection made no difference, not that it seemed to have bothered him. 
            It was as if pain for him was now a natural part of “timelessness”, whereas an injection with the equipment that had been required wasn’t.
            Though the headteacher did something for him that was just what he wanted, somehow taking away a cat that looked in from time to time to have its next round of kittens in his tin cupboard.    
            It was the following afternoon when the stranger arrived. Where the stranger came from he never knew, yet the two of them had one of those conversations when words would have blurred the clarity of what was being exchanged.  
            They appeared to have had no language in common, yet that made the experience that much more complete. It was one of those moments when he could take part and observe at the same time. 
            The stranger, an islander though not from Ugi, most likely would be called a paramedic today, though nothing was done to suggest it was the case. Not that it had mattered. 
            The stranger’s eyes were saying it all, confirming that the white man lying on the bed claiming to be ill was doing so as an excuse to get him away from the “timelessness” that he couldn’t cope with any more.
            In reply, what had just become his half-eyes were pleading that it wasn’t the case. They knew exactly what the stranger was thinking and they would have thought precisely the same if they’d been in the stranger’s place. 
            Yet on this occasion the stranger was wrong. He was the exception that proved the rule. He was desperate to stay.
            The silent conversation didn’t last long and the stranger had gone. No examination, no medication, no taking him away, nothing. Yet as he was still in “timelessness”, again it gave him no additional concern. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Journey 2 – Alangaula to Brisbane
            <br>
            Whatever the stranger’s eyes had seen through his half-eyes, they were the start of his first of two lifesaving journeys, this one of 13 days 10 hours and 2,400 miles as against 75 minutes and 35 miles 10 weeks later, both unique and both critical.   
            <br>
            Alanguala to the “Local Hospital”
            <br>
            They took him away the following day to the “local hospital”. He was on a stretcher as for most of the journey. The students carrying him were members of the hurricane team of a few weeks earlier. 
            All around him was abject failure, humiliation, misery, despair, a world fallen apart, massive self-pity for a headache.
            “Local Hospital”
            “Local hospital?” It was close to the secondary school and fully entitled to both an apology and an explanation as to why had he claimed there’d been no medical facilities on Ugi. 
            Inside was a small hospital ward, meticulously clean with two of the four beds already occupied. However, there appeared nothing by way of medication or treatment, certainly nothing for him. 
            He sensed one of the New Zealand teachers at the secondary school had had some nurse training. Though there seemed nothing more.  
            One of his two fellow patients was an islander with his wife beside him. In the evening they slipped away as silently as by then he’d learned to assume. 
            The other patient was also a New Zealand teacher, this one with a pain that was highly vocal unlike his own. He felt sorry for the teacher and ashamed of himself, that was till the following afternoon, the Friday after his brain blew, when the teacher left noisily in time for the weekend. 
            That night he was asking himself why was everyone asleep, while he, despite being in such pain, had learned to do without it? Think of all the time everyone else was wasting. 
            Soon after he finally fell asleep and wasn’t aware of anything for a day and a half. The refrain had done a remarkable job keeping him going, now no longer on full duty as unconsciousness had taken over for most of the time. 
            The remainder of this journey was a series of very brief clips, sometimes nothing more than a blur.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Headmaster’s Home
            <br>
            The headteacher, generous once again and presumably aware of the limitations of the “local hospital”, had had him moved to the family home. The clip was midday Sunday, a luxurious bed, a delicious plate of scrambled eggs from the secondary school’s tiny farmyard, then him returning it as fast as his paracetamols six days earlier. Unfortunately, there was no clip of him apologising and helping to clear up. He had no idea when he started eating and drinking again. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Wading Away 
            The greatest misery of all was next morning. They took him away from “timelessness”. It was a grey day, at least a grey day in his mind. There was no welcoming bay at the secondary school. The clip was of him wading to a dingy to be rowed to a boat much larger and faster than the workhorses.
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the Worst
            Shortly after, he saw himself on the boat heading to Kira Kira. He’d taken a final glance of Ugi, this time from its other side, the one away from Alanguala. He quickly turned away due to his distress, with no awareness of what would happen next. 
       
            He was standing, therefore having to check his pain. Had it already gone? That would have been terrible. Or even more terrible, one moment begging to stay, a moment late begging the opposite.
            </p>
            <p>
            Kira Kira Airstrip
            The next clip saw him sitting beside the pilot of a small plane with two other passengers behind him waiting to take off. He sensed their annoyance, probably having had to wait a long time for him to arrive. There was certainly something wrong with him, no clip of flying over the ocean at low altitude.
            </p>
            <p>
            Honiara Hospital
            He’d now reached Honiara Hospital, small, meticulously clean like the “local hospital”, walking in, a single room, someone visiting he’d met when waiting for “the Badley”. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Him Meet Me
            Now the big moment, our first formal meeting.
            He was walking along a veranda corridor in the hospital. There was a slight alcove on what had become my right hemi blank side, though he still hadn’t realised. There were some chairs neatly stacked though protruding slightly. Unfortunately, he knocked over the chairs.  
            Which disturbed him, though not by what he’d just done. Rather, it was the chairs themselves. They were the type found anywhere in “somewhere else”, schools, church halls, even hospitals, anywhere other than “timelessness”. 
            Then he started asking himself why had it happened? He found himself cupping his hands to his left side, then my right hemi blank side-eyes. Repeat. He could still see on his left side, not on mine. So clear and obvious, no need to wait for any second opinion. 
            Satisfied, he returned to the chairs. 
            Though only for a moment. First, a full understanding, then the shock, finally the horror. Why? How long would it last? What if it never went? What if it was the start of something even worse?
            Then almost a smile. If he’d just lost part of his vision, it must mean something was seriously wrong with him besides the impossible pain. And immediately his shame had gone. The pain was still there, yet somehow easier to bare. 
            It was as if his pain and I were now working together, me rescuing him. Then immediately his pain dismissed me. It’s the reason why for years and years he referred to me as “no big deal”. 
            Though only till I caused him to catch hemi computer phobia and things began to fall apart (see Paradise Lost 2).
            </p>
            <p>
            Preparing for his Medical Masterclasses
            The hospital was very limited and he understood later that the doctor who performed his lumber-pictured and through it diagnosed a brain abscess or tumour was one of the best. It meant a trip to Brisbane in Australia as quickly as po, the closest place with a neurology department. 
            The final clip of the hospital was his meeting an islander nurse who would be escorting him on the way to Sydney. It was a privilege for him as the nurse was the first islander to complete full training.
            </p>
            <p>
            Henderson Airport  
            It was Saturday morning, already well into the 12th day since his brain blew. He was at Henderson Airport, perhaps not much different from when it was Henderson Airdrome during the Second World War, except then it would have been extremely busy, now almost empty.
            On this occasion there were two planes on the tarmac, both heading for Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea - there were still no direct flights to Australia from the Solomons. The planes were turbo-props, like the one that brought him to Honiara. 
            It meant he’d be able to see the ocean and Bougainville on the way. Or at least in his mind. In reality, he was on a stretcher in the second plane’s hold. The clip saw him talking to a stranger who was trying to reassure him he’d soon be back.
            </p>
            <p>
            Changing Worlds 
            It was now the moment when his mind had to formally switch worlds, from “timelessness” to “somewhere else”. After his meeting with the stranger in his home on Ugi and his first formal meeting with me in Honiara Hospital, this clip, more like a thought bubble than a clip, saw him taking part and observing at the same time. 
            Besides changing worlds, the thought bubble was preparing him for posterity, though for himself alone as no one else would ever be aware of the full significance of the moment to him. It was extremely simple as was the case so often with profound thoughts, here the profundity aided by his condition.
            He accepted his leaving from one world to the other, though uneasily as he was doing what was impossible for so many others, most especially the islanders whose “timelessness” he’d been allowed to share. Except it wasn’t his responsibility for the moment. 
            Instead, as he had the privilege of experiencing both worlds and being allowed to decide for himself which to return to after his pain had gone, his decision was being formally tabled – to return to “timelessness”. 
            He kept on repeating his decision to help make it come true. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Finishing Moment
            He was watching the other passengers on his plane walking across the tarmac of Raboul Airport as he lay in its hold. 
            Apparently, Raboul Airport was the plane’s home base and flying rules required operators to give their planes a health check as soon as possible after flying close to a hurricane.
            Raboul tarmac became special in a strange way, like the day before going back to school. Something heavy was about to happen. Make the best of whatever remained.
            </p>
            <p>
            Returning to Apartheid
            The stopover at Raboul meant he’d missed his Brisbane connection. The clip was of a ward in the Port Moresby Hospital where he’d had to be “hostelled” for the night. He may still have been in Papua New Guinea, yet the ward suggested it wasn’t the case. All the staff and patients were white except for his own nurse. Were PNG islanders ever allowed to be ill? It reminded him of apartheid South Africa. Where did his nurse spend the night?
            </p>
            <p>
            First Taste of “Somewhere Else”
            His change of worlds was symbolised by his change of plane-type – turbo-prop in the hold to three seats removed for him to lie across the seating of a jet. He had no other awareness of anything.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Anywhere in “Somewhere Else”
            Almost there. He was in a taxi along almost any slip road from almost any airport to almost any city in “somewhere else” – with his apologises to Brisbane that welcomed him without question even though he was a foreigner.
            </p>
            <p>
            Princess Alexandra Hospital
            It was now Sunday evening, 13 days since his brain blew. The clip was of him walking to his bed in a ward which seemed vast. Finally, he was feeling uneasy, in a way not before. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Princess Alexandra Hospital to the Royal Brisbane Hospital
            Apparently, every patient from “the islands” was first taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital regardless of what was to happen to them next. 
            His operation was to be the following morning at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. He has no awareness of how he got there.
            </p>
            <p>
            Main Stopover 2 - Royal Brisbane Hospital 
            He thought of not continuing this hemi story. Nothing could ever compare. Except, as with all the hemi stories, once started fate had difficulty finishing.  
            So here he is in the Royal Brisbane, though ignoring the general hospital activity that’s already well known. Or perhaps not? Someone shaved half his head in preparation for his first operation. 
            Then, immediately after leaving intensive care after it, a barber turned up to offer shaving the rest - at the price of a full shave.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ice Sponge Torture Training
            After each of his three operations in the Royal Brisbane, he spent two days in intensive care. On each, one of the other patients was lying unconscious on an icepack to keep his temperature down, 
            and always supported by the patient’s sad elderly mother with her elderly eye-shades. 
            After his first operation his bed was opposite the patient’s and therefore he couldn’t help but see it. After the other two, his bed was next to the patient’s on my right hemi blank side, so now he didn’t have to.
            </p>
            <p>
            Abscess or Tumour? 
            Back in the general ward he learned the distinction between a brain abscess and a brain tumour. He understood he’d been lucky. All the other patients had come in for the removal of a tumour, 
            and while the operation to remove an abscess was more difficult than a tumour, once fully drained it would never return whereas a tumour might. 
            And he was already doing exercises on the ward floor.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pain Comparison
            That was till the pain returned about 10 days later. It was horrendous, or was it? It was an entirely different pain to the one in “timelessness”, a pain shrieking for attention whereas the “timelessness” pain had had complete control. 
            This one didn’t cause him to rush out of the ward or vomit, nor think of earthquakes or worst enemies. It even accepted a painkiller, even if only a couple of paracetamols at a time, definitely eight of them in a day and not 16.
            However, although his two paracetamols did their job, it was only for 110 minutes. It meant he had to endure 130 and without any gradual build up. The pain was extreme again though vulnerable, knowing it couldn’t win all the time. 
            Try a refrain during the pain? Except there was nothing to see or even imagine other than the ward clock, and, unlike in “timelessness”, it appeared to have stopped. Then even more disturbing, how to cope when he ran out of his daily paracetamol supply?
            It happened twice and on both occasions fate came to his rescue, or rather the hospital, with operations 2 and 3. Though his confidence was waning without any explanation as to why the pain kept returning, while other patients were coming and going. 
            So, fate came up with yet another pain, though this one designed to be helpful. It was as painful as the other Australian pain yet different, a standard bladder pain with a temperature.
            However much water he drank, the pain and the temperature wouldn’t go away. Which, in fact, was intentional, pain enough for him to more or less forget about the Australian abscess pain - would it return yet again or not? 
            In the end, he was given yet another operation and this time the pain returned even before they’d wheeled him out of the operating theatre. Though it disappeared shortly after. Which meant fate had done the job for him, the abscess pain hadn’t returned and never would as such. 
             </p>
            <p>
            Job Done?
            It was all over. Though he still felt woozy, and at the same time angry at being told he’d always have to wear glasses. At least standard ones rather than something like the sad elderly mother with her unconscious son still lying in intensive care. 
            He was told the glasses would counter the slight tension above his eyes.
            Anyway, he shouldn’t be thinking that way. He should be grateful. Plenty of mention of recouperation to complete sorting him out. A doctor and his family had even offered him a home before he went back. Except back to where?
            </p>
            <p>
            Preparation for Fury
            Now the moment he’d been trying not to think about, concentrating on his abscess in hospital, nothing beyond. Except from time to time he imagined crewing a catamaran back to Honiara, pure light against his previous gloom. 
            And the first person he’d seen on regaining consciousness after operation 1 had been his mother all the way from there. She’d come like the elderly mother to be with her son, yet his mother had had to come all this way. 
            He loved his mother and hated fate more than ever for arranging things this way. One of his reasons for going away had been to start a life of his own and the only person who would be able to bring him back was the person beside him. 
            Even now there’s a part of him that wishes she hadn’t come, though almost certainly he’d have been dead a few days later. Death was different when young, a challenge rather than an automatic defeat – says he who still hasn’t met either.

            Journey 3 – Brisbane to London  
            Which is why there wasn’t a Journey 3. 
            </p>
            Journey 4 – Outside Guildford to East London 
            He was back and hating it, taking himself away on long walks to get himself going again physically and to protect everyone from himself. He’d never imagined hearing him using the word “fury” on himself. 
            Medically, he had alternative good days and bad. 26th April was a bad one, a Sunday, 11 weeks and 6 days since his brain blew, the evening damp and gloomy. It deserved nothing more than a hot bath and early bed, the bath hotter than usual.
            Perhaps it was the reason for what happened next.                                  
            He had what’s now old-fashioned soap in his right hand ready to be transferred to his left hand to continue the washing procedure as usual. Except his hand refused to cooperate. Odd, it’d never performed that way before. 
            Try again, and with the same result. Now annoyed, he tried again with the same result. At last, fourth time lucky. 
            The washing almost over, something happened that reminded him of the crucifixion story – that’s if he can put it this way. Blood and a clearish liquid oozed from the left side of his head, in fact from the bone-flap they’d formed to drain his abscess and always put back. 
            No fear, just surprise. The bleeding and oozing over, he completed his bath and almost made it to his bed when he had his first epileptic fit.  
            The first thing he remembered when he regained consciousness was someone talking on the phone downstairs – male, middle aged, authoritative. The call seemed to be going on and on. 
            He assumed the voice belonged to a doctor given what seemed to have happened. 
            It must have been about 7.30pm, though he had no idea for how long he’d been unconscious. The doctor was unlikely to have lived locally and must have looked in at him before starting to phone. And his mother would have had to do a fair amount of explaining before.  
            By then, fate had returned, this time to win him the jackpot three times in a row. Critically, the year was 1969. G.Ps. were still responsible for their own “out of hours” calls and the G.P. on call that gloomy night was the practice’s senior partner. 
            Very properly, an “out of hours” contract doctor since then would have arranged for him to be sent to the nearest hospital with an A and E department. That one also had a neurology department. 
            Except, given the year, his mother would have told the G.P. that his consultant in Brisbane had been aware of another Australian consultant who’d recently been headhunted by the renowned Royal London Hospital. 
            No email or internet, yet by the time the G.P. was off the phone his first operation at “the London” had been agreed for first thing next morning and an ambulance was on its way to take him there.

            Main Stopover 3 – Journey’s End
            Of all the drama in Paradise Lost I, the most dramatic he missed. He was fast asleep while they were saving his life for him in the first of his six medical masterclasses in “the London”.
            As soon as he regained consciousness, he began to appreciate “the London” routine, nothing special, just part of a beginning that already had started to end. The tension above his eyes had already gone. 
            There was no point in anyone picking up the glasses he’d already ordered as he would never have to wear them.  
            The best example of the routine was his x-rays. He remembered two previous ones, between operations 2 and 3, nothing between operation 3 and discharged. Now it was every other day including weekends. A nice outing as well as he got to know everyone along the way.  
            Later, he was asked to help with the tea trolley. Nice one, though that left me wondering whether I’d been forgotten. He was never given a driving test despite the risk of hemi bumping. Or rather, he only thought of this years later. He was still completely hemi unaware.  
            With the routine continuing, he even started feeling proud of having an abscess, something that wasn’t everyday, him still young and things going well. So, fate looked in again. Nothing in comparison with what he’d gone through already, though certainly a nuisance. 
            Or was it trying to repeat what it’d done for him at the Royal Brisbane, giving him a pain as bad as his abscess pain yet fairly benign?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
            </p>
            <p>
            Talking Rubbish      
            The answer was immediate. Besides his delight at finding the tension around his eyes had already gone, massively on the downside was finding he’d lost the ability to communicate. He understood as in the past, yet whatever he wanted to say came out as rubbish. 
            He gave up trying after watching visitors craning their heads to suggest they understood what he was saying, while he knew they couldn’t as he couldn’t either. His mind was functioning as usual, it was the printer in it that was letting things down.
            At least fate had done everyone else an immense favour. His silence protected everyone from his fury at being back here, while he was soon challenging himself to some new form of communication. 
            Fortunately, operation 4 rescued him from such nonsense, even from his having to study Jack and Jill Book 2. The operation had started the reconfiguring of his communication. Very gently, though with complete certainty, his mind was progressing to 98% of the past within 21 months.
            </p>
            <p>
            Epilepsy
            The downside again was his realisation that he’d had a fit. The abscess was special, his communication loss as well, not so epilepsy. He didn’t know much about it, yet hated the thought of it. Not that it implied anything against anyone who had it, quite the reverse as they tried to cope with it.  
            His epilepsy disturbed him more than anything, an extension of his fury. He tried to convince himself that the fit was a “one off” due to the build up for the return of his abscess. Yet he couldn’t convince even himself. 
            His fury, his fear, was that the fit meant he was no longer the person he’d grown up with, himself, and he could no longer trust himself. There was plenty else going on around him, yet his fear never ran away. Imagine being controlled by a pill.
            </p>
            <p>
            Friendly Connection
            At least his fury was asswaged for a time every day by his friendly connection. Soon after operation 1, when he woke first thing in the morning and again in the afternoon if he’d been asleep, he could express three syllables as if still in “timelessness”.  
            He could repeat the syllables four times, though only with care. Repeat them too quickly and his friendly connection would immediately be lost as if in anger. Equally if he added something or tried something entirely new. 
            Say the syllables too slowly and this time his friendly connection would quietly disappear in the same way as with his correct four repeats.
            It was as if his friendly connection was saying “good bye” and “see you again”. 
            Just on one day, morning and afternoon, when there was no connection. It was a very bad day. He hadn’t realised how important his friendly connection had become. Now he was completely out on his own. He thought of the people who appear to be brain dead, yet fully connected without anyone realising. 
            It was frightening. Except his friendly connection was back again next morning as if nothing had happened.
             
            His friendly connection was as if powered by an elderly battery. Fully charged overnight and the connection was strong, in the afternoon when less recharge time had been available it was weak.
            
            He’d wanted to share his discovery, in part for confirmation, except he couldn’t. He didn’t have any other syllables to explain. He was sad not to have had a chance to say “good bye” and “thank you” to his friendly connection after operation 4. He’d still like to know what it has all about.

            Fate’s Final Straw 
            It was as good as over. With his communication getting going again, his fit was far below fate’s usual destructive standard. Operations 5 and 6 had been doing nothing more than the clearing up. So inevitably fate was back again to remind him that it always had to win. 
            Shortly after breakfast one morning, his temperature suddenly shot up. 
            Instantly he remembered the unconscious patient in intensive care in the Royal Brisbane lying unconscious on his icepack to keep his temperature down. Now up, his own temperature was refusing to go down.
            What followed was inevitable. He already knew it due to his neurology nurse training. The pain was completely different from any of his other pains, mental joining in, even worse as it was being forced on him by others. 
            An iced sponge in a hot day causes screams of delight. With the heat caused within and the ice imposed on him, it was torture. This time it remembered him of people being burnt at the stake in the Middle Ages, with the caption “for their own good”. 
            Though it must have been almost as unpleasant for the nurses involved as for him.
            Then suddenly his temperature slid down in time for tea, as fast down as it had shot up. Immense relief all round. Whatever the reason, it had gone. Though it took him quite a time to settle down. 
            Or rather it wasn’t over. A day off, then the torture returned, every alternative day. Except his day off wasn’t a day of rest. Just preparing for the next and frighteningly worrying as to how much longer could he endure it. 
            Add to it, if his temperature had shot up, why should it bother to come down, or for how much longer alternative days?
            He was now weak, tired, wanting to roll up in a ball and go to sleep, in a few days go to sleep and never wake up. It was now five months since his brain blew. Everyone had done everything for him. Now it didn’t matter anymore.
            It was the 10th day, an “off day”, when another stranger arrived. His imagination saw the stranger walking passed his window and leaving soon after. Except his ward was on the second floor and he couldn’t see any entrance. 
            Not that it mattered. The stranger had come from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. He was told he had malaria. The traditional way to cope without any treatment was to leave him alone to sweat it out in the way his mind had wanted. Except here he was surrounded by treatment. 
            Amost none was needed on him. A tiny pill once a day for 10 days and that was that. And already no more torture. He prepared himself for it the following day, the pill couldn’t have saved him already. Except it had, while more than half a million people are still dying from malaria every year.  
            Why malaria? There was malaria in “timelessness”.
            He’d taken a pill against it every Friday evening, including four weeks before leaving for it and four weeks after in Brisbane. Except he’d forgotten the Friday evening in the “local hospital” when he couldn’t eat or drink and the following Friday in Honiara Hospital was a blank. And what about the islanders?

            Happy Torture Ending
            After its torture trick, fate decided to take a break till the hemi main story and Paradise Lost 2. Except even the neurology team came up with its own variety. Scans hadn’t been invented then. Instead, he was given another Middle Ages torture, “the wheel”, turning him around in 360 degrees. 
            Upside down he vomited again, though no one cared. The torture confirmed his abscess had completely gone. 
            Which led to his setting off with me on our trial and error hemi journey to find out what it was like to have a hemi - and with no thought of trauma or recuperation despite it all.
            Why Paradise Lost 1 after a billion to one against win? His loss of “timelessness”. Paradise Lost 2 will be its follow on.
