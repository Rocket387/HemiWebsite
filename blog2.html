    <h3> Paradise Lost 2 - Hemi Horror </h3>
    
    <p>
    Hemi Welcome <br>
    In case we haven’t met before, a very warm
    welcome. If we have, a very warm welcome back.
    If we haven’t, I’m a right homonymous hemianopia, naturally hemi for short. My strange name means he can no longer see anything on my right hemi blank
    side except for a tiny bit as I’m not rectangular. “He” is the poor unfortunate who was landed with me.
    All the hemi detail about me is in the hemi main story along with 300 hemi images. Paradise Lost 1 is where it all started, in a tiny island in the South Pacific
    with no medical facilities where fate gave him a brain abscess and me, then ended winning him the jackpot three time in the same night at odds of a billion to
    one against to save his life. Beyond the Scan is slightly different from the two Paradise Losts, a medical condition that according to a scan doesn’t exist.
    Naming Paradise Lost 1 this way sounds confusing after having had his life saved during it. For him his loss was Ugi, his tiny island home in the Solomon
    Islands he called “timelessness”. So remote, life was complete in its own way. It will be the first thought in his mind when the fuse blows here - “why had his life
    been saved to end up like this?”
  </p>

<h3 >Manageable Times</h3>  
  <p>
    
    <strong>Disability</strong><br>
    Paradise Lost 2 has a very long fuse and,
    even when it appeared to have blown, it turned out only to be a trial.
    It all happened in and around a South London community centre, as different to Ugi as it could possibly be. Though what he was involved in was much the
    same with both, school, adult learning, job employment, youth activities, plenty more.
    Except the centre played only a minor part in this hemi story. It was his employer that dominated and, at the end, some local councillors. While hidden
    throughout was me, even more so than elsewhere. If it hadn’t been for me, nothing would ever have happened.
    Except perhaps he should never have been given the job. Not long before, he’d survived only a class and a half of Beginners’ I.T. spent searching for the
    cursor in the vast emptiness of a computer screen. Look at File and his half-eyes see nothing more.
    By the time he was appointed, he could manage well enough with the computer basics in a “do it yourself” way, then had to rely on colleagues for anything more demanding – such as Sage, the soft-ware used by the centre’s bookkeeper.
    Of course, his new employer could have checked his level of computer literacy. In addition, and as everywhere else, he hadn’t been asked for anything further
    after ticking the Disabilities box in his application form.
    Adding to what he calls hemi computer phobia, a few years earlier his half-eyes started to get letters, words and numbers mixed up – due to his abscess, for a
    short time he’d been unable to communicate, this almost completely recovered, then 30 years on his rewiring in his brain started to fray a bit at the edges,
    hence my rewiring hemi companion. Letter and word mistakes weren’t much more than an added nuisance. Not so numbers as he first became aware, saying
    £500,000 instead of £300,00 at a public meeting and denied it. Fortunately, number mistakes were seldom. Anyway, numbers were the responsibility of the
    centre’s bookkeeper.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Corporate</strong><br> 
    With no expectation of being back here from the
    South Pacific, once out of hospital fate had established a “profession” for him, rescuing community centres at risk of closure.
    All his previous centres had been long established charities. He was employed by their Boards who left him to get on with the job. This final centre, however,
    was different. A corporate had used the offer of a centre as a sweetener to the residents of the area it wanted to take over.
    The centre that the corporate built was smaller than promised and badly build as the contractor had just lost all its other contracts locally. Even two health and
    safety and one child protection requirements were missing. In addition, there was no long term financial planning – half the centre’s construction and running
    costs for three years came from Government regeneration programmes. He was brought in six months after the centre had been open as very little was
    happening.
    Turning things around hadn’t been difficult. The corporate’s approach to running it had been 9.00 am to 5.00 pm weekdays with anything else by appointment.
    His approach was morning to evening seven days a week.
    The centre’s biggest problem, as with all centres, was how to meet its overheads. By establishing a charity, he’d access to funds the corporate couldn’t. By the
    end, it was most likely the smallest in the country running the Government’s two employability support schemes and a local authority adult learning contract
    enrolling 1000 students a year, again with much else. Besides maximising its value to local residents, the centre was coping with a steady reduction in the
    financial support of the corporate that would have had to meet it in full without the charity now that the regeneration funding had gone.
    When establishing the charity, he’d set up the appropriate contracts and terms and conditions for the staff it was employing. Yet the corporate continued to
    employ the staff it had recruited, the administrator/bookkeeper (now referred to as “the bookkeeper”), the cleaner and himself. It also failed to provide any
    formal agreement with the charity despite the charity having legal responsibility for everything relating to the centre’s operation.
    He was aware of TUPE, under employment law protecting employees being transferred to a new employer. Nothing had happened when the charity took over
    and he assumed the corporate with its HR understood employment law better than he did. And at the time it hadn’t mattered as relations between the
    corporate and the charity were good. It was then that he imagined Paradise Regained.
  </p>

  <h3>Corporate Contempt</h3>
  <p>
    
    
    <strong>Trouble Brewing</strong> <br>
    Except relations with the corporate were
    brittle, seven line-managers in ten years, one twice. And he had to perform duties as an employee of the corporate that were of no relevance to his job. Most
    disturbing of all, any replacement for him would have been the employee of the charity, not the corporate, free of any line-management and meaningless tasks
    corporate tasks.
    “The Slug” His fourth line-manager was “the slug”, named
    as such by local residents - no interest in the centre while also a member of the local arm of the corporate’s management team that was at odds with the same
    local residents. Some members of the charity’s Board were leading the opposition. He was in the middle, while fully supporting the residents.
    The Bookkeeper At the same time, he was becoming
    increasingly concerned at the bookkeeper’s performance. Originally excellent enough to be upgraded twice by the corporate, then things began to changed
    including delays in financial reporting. Internal and external audits continued to be satisfactory, yet he remained uneasy given his own computer and numbers
    vulnerability.
    The bookkeeper had always had care responsibilities. They’d recently increased, this leading to a move out of London and then a request to work four days a
    week while continuing the same hours. He didn’t like the prospect with the centre operating seven days morning to evening. However, as a charity it had a
    responsibility for its staff as well as its users - though the bookkeeper wasn’t employed by it as “the slug” pointed out.
    His bookkeeper concern became such that he knew he had to act. However, that would mean losing control. With the bookkeeper still employed by the
    corporate, he’d have to report to “the slug” who would pass it on to HR which had no interest in the anomaly of the bookkeeper’s employment, instead of
    following the charity’s terms and conditions as he’d always been able to do elsewhere.
    The standard practice of corporate staff facing a disciplinary was to go off on long term sick leave of up to six months. With no formal agreement between the
    corporate and the charity, that would have left him at risk of having to run the charity on his own, while his relationship with the bookkeeper was such that he
    would have a fair chance of resolving the issue without having to take the matter any further.
    There was also a trivial matter relating to his bookkeeper that, in the end, turned out not to be trivial at all. The bookkeeper received copies of his non-private
    emails. Due to me, when he received email extensions his half-eyes could always see extension 1, though not any 2 or 3 unless there was also an extension
    4. Early, he’d missed a couple of extensions that way. He knew he should always be double checking due to me, yet using the bookkeeper seemed a sensible
    backup.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Law and Betrayal</strong><br> 
    It wouldn’t have been intended, except
    before long “the slug” did what seemed to have been an immense favour, hiring a consultant to “health check” the centre. The consultant instantly reported the
    impossibility of his position, responsible for the charity while still an employee of the corporate, in addition the continuing informal relationship between the
    corporate and the charity.
    To his amazement and delight, the corporate accepted the report, even coming up with a transfer date of only 14 weeks ahead. It meant he could hold his
    bookkeeper concern till after the transfer and then deal with the matter himself.
    The transfer date came and went without any movement. No further date was fixed, though he was continually being reassured the transfer would still be going
    ahead.
    Aware of the keenness of the corporate’s local management arm to further reduce its contribution to centre overheads, he sent a letter to the parties involved
    in the transfer stating the three corporate transferees waved their TUPE financial guarantee in the interest of it going ahead. The bookkeeper signed with no
    hesitation. He never received any response.
    After “the slug”, it seemed it was HR’s turn to be unexpectedly helpful. It recommended to the charity’s Board that it find out more about TUPE. He discovered
    a scheme that provided free legal advice to charities, the advice usually given by a trainee under supervision. As a result, he was alarmed to find himself
    silently hurtling up London’s Guerkin to meet someone from a firm of international solicitors who introduced herself as the TUPE Queen of London.
    The solicitor’s advice was simple, brief and to the point. The three corporate employees had been automatically transferred from the corporate to the charity
    the moment the charity took responsibility for the centre. Under TUPE, staff were automatically transferred unless other arrangements had been made for
    them by their still current employer. The fact that the corporate was still paying the three employees made no difference. Good luck to the charity if it still wasn’t
    having to pay them itself. The solicitor then swept out of the room without confirming in writing what he’d just been told.
    He informed the Chair of the charity, now as good as his new employer, the outcome of the TUPE meeting and his intention of immediately writing for the
    missing confirmation. However, despite agreeing to the meeting in the first place, the Chair asked him not to do so after all, saying it would be in the charity’s
    better interest.
    
    13 months after the consultant’s report came the transfer meeting between the corporate and the charity. Except those present from the charity were informed
    by the corporate’s relevant Director that the meeting should be treated as informal. There was to be no change in the relationship between the them. Not that
    anything had happened over the past 13 months to justify the agreement no longer being required legally and on the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>To Go or Not to Go?</strong><br> 
    It was too much, now time to go. The
    centre had been his second home for seven years, yet his treatment by the corporate was impossible, quite likely wrong in legal. Someone else should take
    over free of the corporate’s control.
    Except where to go? He was coming close to the dreaded retirement mark and most likely at the centre he’d be able to stay for longer. Even more to the point,
    anywhere else employment wise would check his hemi computer phobia credentials, understandably never imagining his numbers
    unease.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Third Time Lucky?</strong> <br>
    So, would it be third time lucky? Amazingly,
    even the Government was trying to help him get transferred. It’d come up with a scheme to encourage charities to merge, the objective to reduce their
    overheads. Just before the corporate reneged on the transfer agreement with the charity, the charity had started negotiations with another local charity under
    the Government’s scheme.
    The negotiations were in two stages, an outline and the detail if agreed to proceed, nearly five months in all. In the end the other charity said “no”, the main
    reason being the lack of any formal agreement between the corporate and the charity and the corporate’s negative approach to this opportunity. Had the two
    charities merged, the new staffing arrangement would that the bookkeeper restricted to administrative duties and his bookkeeper concern soon resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Limbo-Land</strong><br>
     By then he’d been carrying the burden
    of his bookkeeper concern for 18 months and now had no option other than to inform “the slug”. He wondered what the response would be to his failure to do
    so before and without his being able to blame the corporate’s Director who was responsible. There’d been no change in the bookkeeper situation, insufficient
    financial information as far as he was concerned yet always sufficient to satisfy internal and external audits.
    
    Except “the slug” had disappeared. Presumably, corporate records would show that he’d had a line-manager throughout his corporate employment, yet on the
    ground it wasn’t the case. Sadly for the corporate, “the slug’s” absence couldn’t be hidden for long, purged with other members of its local management team.
    The corporate had to acknowledge the residents’ complaints were fully justified.
    Though even if he had had a line-manager, there would have been reason for some procrastination of his own. Anyone representing the bookkeeper at a
    corporate disciplinary would have pointed out the impossible position the corporate had put the bookkeeper under, waiting 12 months to be transferred from
    the corporate to one charity, then nearly six months to another, finally being expected to continue as if nothing had happened. There’d have to be yet another
    pause before taking any action.
    Yet, by now to be expected with fate pulling the strings, it didn’t work out quite that way. For a reason unknown to him, there would be a six months delay
    before a new line-manager was appointed. In the meanwhile, he was to have one of his previous line-managers, the Director of the corporate responsible for
    the continuing impossibility of his position by ignoring what had been formally agreed.
    Could he really risk accusing an up and coming corporate Director of breaking the TUPE law, at least making his job impossible? The prospect made him feel
    even more weary. All these years of centre achievement while having to carry the burden of such corporate nonsense, and knowing no one else would ever
    have to go through it when he finally left.
    After four months the Director handed over the line-management responsibility to another corporate consultant, this time one brought in for a purpose other
    than the centre. As far as he was concerned, again he had no line-manager, not that he complained.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>24 Months</strong><br>
     Later His new line-manager, line-
    manager 6, arrived 25 months after the original consultant reported the impossibility of his position. He’d prepared a detailed report in advance on his
    
    bookkeeper concern, concern again over his own failure to report it till now.
    There was more than enough evidence to justify taking immediate action as he would have done himself more than two years earlier in any other
    circumstance. Instead, the new line-manager decided to work directly with the bookkeeper. It still hadn’t led to anything when he finally discovered the fraud
    seven months later. Though that hadn’t caused the fuse blowing.
    He’d stuck to his original decision not to share his concern with “the slug” and HR. As a result, he’d failed everyone, failed them due to his ridiculous naivety,
    refusing to make a simple demand for a hard copy of the information hidden from his half-eyes by the bookkeeper’s use of Sage, long since not wanting to
    know as he was already far too late to be able to do anything himself, still justifying himself due to the risk of HR reacting to my concern in such a way that he
    had to concentrate on this single issue and a probable disciplinary, not his job running the independent charity. What about the auditors? The buck stopped
    with him.
    The bookkeeper had been aided by a partner who was an I.T. expert and they’d been running two bank accounts, the real and the false, with him allowing
    them plenty of time off for the purpose. In the end, they were caught only due to their getting too greedy. The bookkeeper was given an 18 months prison
    sentence suspended for two years, presumably helped by the bookkeeper’s care responsibilities that were genuine as well as by pleading guilty. Fate had
    failed him again by not allowing him to be called as a witness. If he had, the corporate would have been in the dock as well.
    Instead, fate had had a special laugh just before he discovered the fraud. The charity was awarded the Matrix Standard, a national kitemark of quality
    assurance to add to its Ofsted adult learning awards. The Matrix Standard inspects organisations, usually far larger than the centre, as seen through the eyes
    of their users. Did they feel welcome and safe? Did they get what they’d come for? Would they recommend the centre to anyone else? The only person at the
    centre who didn’t feel safe was the person who was making it possible.
  </p>
  <h3> Political Contempt Joining In</h3>
  <p>
   
    <strong>Everything Other Than His Job</strong><br>
    Everything that follows relates to the fraud
    except for the racism complaint and towards the end with the intervention of the ELSFA. Though the complaint would have been unlikely without the fraud as
    the Treasurer only became actively involved in the charity due to it. In addition, the Head of Adult Learning would never have treated the charity in the way the
    politicians did, in no way having the authority to get the centre instantly closed without going through the recognised process. Perhaps amazingly, the centre
    continued to perform much as always till the final moment, even without a key member of staff for seven months and after that with a reduced staff capability.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Easier to Keep Going Than Give Up</strong><br>
     He discovered the fraud on a
    Friday evening. He had the weekend to reflect. Or rather go numb. There was nothing to think.
    On the Monday he reported to the Treasurer of the charity, not the Chair who was ill and apparently for the first time. And somehow his mind had already
    known what the Treasurer was going to do, something impossible for the Chair. Go to the charity’s bank to have its account frozen, then proceed to the
    Treasurer’s own bank and return with a large amount of cash, in fact £20,000.
    It was incredibly generous, yet did it make any sense? How could the centre still be run without a bookkeeper who was also its administrator, without a bank
    account and with him unreliable with numbers. The current financial year anticipated a turnover of nearly £500,000, the adult learning contract worth nearly
    £200,000, the tutor and staff team totalling 23. It seemed mad to even consider continuing.
    Yet his numbness was in control. It was easier to continue than stop. Collapse later. At least he’d have tried.
    At least in addition as well, there were a few things on his side. It was early July, the adult learning programme almost over till late September. It seemed no
    one was accusing him of complicity in the fraud, too naive to be risked. The fraud saved him from trying to learn some Excel – while in no way imagining the
    fraud, he’d recently asked his line-manager for some funding so he could hire some 1 to 1 training to help reduce his finance dependency on the bookkeeper.
    Overall, what was a complete disaster to him didn’t seem to disturb anyone else. Not even the corporate, though any complain would have to be muted as the
    bookkeeper had been its own employee. And under the charity’s Treasurer, it was already planning to sue the corporate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Phony War</strong> <br>
    Life continued remarkably smoothly all things
    considered till the end of November. Tutors and staff quietly got on with their jobs as usual, highly efficient and effective as ever. And the breakdown in the
    relationship between the corporate and the charity meant he was largely left alone except for an increase in line-manager supervisions.
    The police were charming – visiting the police station became the equivalent of having time off and it was good to talk to someone who appeared to be
    listening. New auditors were appointed straightforwardly as if fraud was an everyday affair to them which most likely it was. The Charity Commissioners were
    informed, the charity given plenty of time to explain what had happened and show how things were being changed. The charity’s bank reopened its standard
    account surprisingly quickly, only the online had been affected. It meant he’d very seldom had to pay anyone or anything using cash.
    New to him as a stand-in administrator/bookkeeper included updating the timetable, supervising the receptionist who now had additional duties, sorting long
    outstanding orders and payments, and chequebook embarrassments as numbers kept refusing to cooperate in a way never before.
    His main unease was having to see his line-manager fortnightly instead of monthly as before, and again he could hardly point to the corporate’s contribution to
    what had happened. The supervisions could never end early. As a result, he found himself sharing information he otherwise wouldn’t have done.
    Meanwhile, the Board of the charity continued to deliberate suing the corporate, the Chair – now recovered - and the Treasurer at loggerheads, while he, an
    employee of the corporate, was in effect running the centre informally on the charity’s behalf. Perhaps he was entitled to some form of legal protection, though
    he was hardly in a position to start finding out.
    
    The corporate, as to be expected, was now in a hurry to transfer the cleaner and himself under TUPE, or as how the corporate claimed it to be. It informed the
    Board of the charity that it was prepared to transfer its savings till the end of the financial year from no longer having to pay the bookkeeper if used for the
    same purpose, though obviously only if the two parties were talking to each other once again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fate’s Hidden</strong><br>
     It was then that fate
    added a new dimension to its entertainment. There’d been mention that some local politicians of the party now in power were going to use the fraud as an
    excuse to have the centre closed. The charity’s adult learning contract with the local authority was such that it would be unable to continue if the contract was
    lost.
    The strange notion had nothing to do with the centre itself. The Chair of the charity who’d previously been a local politician of what was then the party in power
    dismissed the matter when told of it. Nothing happened, so he did as well. Then he realised that nothing would, if there were to be, till the end of the academic
    year. Leave the centre alone to do its job as usual, then act.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>Beginning of the End</strong><br>
     “Phony war” was the wrong expression, rather
    the calm before the storm. The calm for him ended when the Board of the charity decided not to sue the corporate. The noise at the meeting had been such
    that he would have asked anyone else to leave. It was something he foolishly mentioned to his line-manager at one of their meaningless meetings. He was
    told he should have done as he didn’t work for the charity. Yet another example of how the corporate rated the charity.
    The Board’s decision not to sue instantly turned things upside down for him. One moment the only link between the corporate and the charity, next interference
    or being ignored. Towards the end and unbelievably, he even found himself wondered whether he might be better off staying with the corporate given the way
    some of the charity’s Board members were now behaving.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>Hemi Horror</strong><br>
     Warm-Up The real hemi horror started when a
    last-minute employability support maternity cover complained of racism against the charity’s Treasurer – he’d had to bring in the cover overnight as the long
    agreed cover had pulled out the day before a contract with Jobcentre Plus was about to begin. It was much the nastiest incident the centre had ever
    experienced. It ended with the Chair of the charity apologising on behalf of the Board. However, the incident lingered unpleasantly even after the Treasurer
    had resigned and the maternity cover's contract had ended. With so much else building up, the issue was never addressed organisationally in the way that it
    should.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>14 Week Contracts</strong><br>
     At the same time, with relations restored
    between the corporate and the charity, the corporate transferred to the charity its saving from no longer having to pay the ex-bookkeeper. There was now a
    rush to recruit replacement staff before it was too late to make it any sense.
    A full-time administrator and a part-time bookkeeper were recruited, employees of the charity as long term agreed. Inevitably, the interest in the positions was
    extremely poor as the contracts on offer were for only 14 weeks and without anything to encourage the prospect of continuation.
    At the same time, as the funding came from the corporate his line-manager required copies of his fortnightly supervision reports on both new employees, even
    after his own working hours had been reduced by HR.
  </p>
  <p>
    Disciplinary<br>
     With the new staff appointed and however
    unsuitable they might be, it was time for HR to discipline him due to the fraud. The letter arrived just before Christmas, the event immediately after.
    That year Christmas fell on a Sunday. With the centre now the home of an Alcoholics Anonymous Sunday meeting, apparently the largest in Europe, he was
    asked to open as Christmas was the hardest time of the year for anyone with alcohol unease. So, he walked to the centre like the meeting’s attendees for one
    of the best Christmases he ever had, wishing only that someone from the corporate was present to experience what community centres were truly about.
    He’d never been associated with a disciplinary before and never imagined he would. Given what had happened over the years, shouldn’t his best form of
    defence be attack - the TUPE Queen of London, the corporate’s consultant who’d stated the impossibility of his position, the Chair of the charity who’d been
    told as well, also point out the performance of one of the corporate’s Directors along with his line-manager now playing prosecutor?
    He might even have reminded HR that he’d rescued the corporate from a failed centre and made it a success at very limited cost to itself. Remind it as well
    that he was disabled – on one occasion he’d tested HR’s interest, it offered him something that showed him it hadn’t understood and hadn’t bothered to find
    out, and immediately forgot about it.
    However, he did nothing of the kind. It wasn’t his way. He was being disciplined as the employee of a corporate, meaning HR, that had no interest or
    awareness of the centre and how he was being forced to work. He’d already been crushed, the Head of HR now getting annoyed that the disciplinary was
    taking so long. Why hadn’t he left long ago, his replacement able to run the centre free of any corporate interference?
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>Disciplinary Aftermath</strong><br>
     The only punishment he can remember
    resulting from the disciplinary was being told to immediately take two weeks annual leave. Pretty generous and fair enough as he hadn’t had a holiday for
    goodness knows how long. Till his line-manager stepped in on his behalf to suggest it wouldn’t be helpful just then with two highly inexperienced temporary
    staff only just recruited.
    Instead, a 28 hours corporate working week instead of the usual 35 was imposed to last for 10 weeks. Working at home on Mondays was forbidden, though at
    least no one ever came to inspect, nor the local library, nor anywhere else. Presumably HR never imagined working in the evening or at the weekend, most
    certainly not his real working hours.
    It was a farce, a dangerous one, though he wasn’t in a state to put it that way. He’d already been working well over 70 hours a week, 80 before the end. His
    line-manager was fully aware, though naturally avoided being in a position to acknowledge it. The Chair of the charity behaved as if unaware of anything
    unnatural was happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Praying for a Fit</strong><br>
     It didn’t happen precisely then, more like a
    month or two later, yet before long he found himself praying for a fit. They’d only ever been seldom, though more recently in inappropriate places - a swimming
    pool, smashing his head along the pavement very early in the morning, crossing a major road without any intention or awareness. He didn’t want anything to
    stop him from returning to work next morning as had always been the case, just remind everyone he was human as well. Fate refused to play ball.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Entertainment HR Style</strong><br>
    Or rather fate did, though in one of its
    entertaining ways. Shortly after the disciplinary, something happened he’d forgotten, asking his line-manager eight months earlier for some Excel training
    money as a pointer to his bookkeeper concern.
    Perhaps no such help could be considered while waiting for a disciplinary? In any other situation he’d have informed his line-manager he didn’t want what he’d
    asked for any longer. Yet then his relationship with the corporate was such it would have been foolish.
    A very nice person came from somewhere to assess him for what he didn’t want. The person apologised for not having any experience of visual impairment.
    However, their report took him to central London to meet a clinical psychologist. Naturally the psychologist took the matter very seriously, though the questions
    asked were laughable if he could remember how.
    Two weeks later he was on the Victoria Line to see a private G.P., except he never made the appointment on time. The Victoria Line had had a problem
    somewhere along the way. He needed three buses to get there and was never at his best when taking me along to unknown places in a hurry and without any
    
    form of A to Z. At least the replacement journey was completed on time. The G.P. was charming on both occasions which by now was unnatural to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Board v. Staff</strong> <br>
    The part-time bookkeeper had to be replaced at
    contract end, a replacement arranged with encouraging ease as at last the corporate hadn’t had to be involved. Also the administrator in ordinary
    circumstances, except they weren’t. It would have been irresponsible to go back three months and with even more issues building up, though regrettably the
    administrator was contributing to them as well.
    The administrator was competent, though appeared never to have retained a job for long. And for a reason almost immediately apparent, a personality that
    didn’t blend in an operation where everyone belonged even if several never meet. Add a new member of the Board with a similar challenging approach and he
    found himself having to waste time trying to arrange things to avoid the two meeting.
    Similarly, a Head of the local authority’s adult learning service had introduced him to its team leader responsible for employability support. Before long the
    Head had retired and joined the charity’s Board. At the same time, the employability support team leader was assisting the charity with one of its own
    employability support contracts. Only then did he discover how deeply they disliked each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Board Alone</strong><br>
     Things won’t have been easy for the charity’s
    Board members, especially for those who were on the Board at the time of the consult’s report that had highlighted financial scrutiny issues as well as his
    impossible position. Except it was he who was directly responsible, not them.
    Though he became increasingly concerned at the Board’s lack of understanding of the way ahead. The centre already had a programme and manageable
    budget despite the fraud that the Board had long agreed, with further developments held back only for lack of funding. With the fraud discovered, it should now
    be possible to proceed once the financial position had been fully clarified. Yet there was an attitude of starting again, the Chair of the charity already making a
    financial commitment that would cause further problems before long.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>TUPE Again</strong><br> 
    HR organised a meeting to describe TUPE to
    the cleaner and himself, regardless of the fact they’d had such a meeting three years before. The meeting won’t have been as easy for the HR staff expected,
    the cleaner’s daughter having a similar job to them elsewhere and had fully briefed her mother.
    Every month his line-manager assumed the transfer would have been completed, yet it never did. If it had, under TUPE the charity would have been
    responsible for his sick leave entitlement.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Playing Chess with Death</strong><br>
    Despite everything that fate had been
    throwing at him, the centre was continuing to deliver. As a result, it must have started worrying it had lost its touch. So, it threw in its biggest gun which
    reminded him of the Ingmar Bergman classic, the Seventh Seal, when the knight had to play chess with Death.
    The Education and Learning Skills Funding Agency (ELSFA) was responsible for funding adult learning as much else. Two years earlier, it’d alerted all adult
    learning providers across the country that there’d be major changes in the programme, then decided to hold back. The current year was the penultimate, the
    final one to include preparation for whatever was to follow. There was no suggestion of any change in contracts midway.
    Then well into the academic year, the ELSFA suddenly required some major changes in advance of the final year. In any other situation he would have been
    concerned. However, he was already so punch-drunk by everything else that he simply absorbed it along with everything else. In one sense it was easier than
    the rest, part of his regular work and therefore free of corporate or charity Board member interference.
    First, providers were told to carry out some research into the likely implications of the planned changes. For the centre, there was only one question of
    relevance. As adult learning was no longer to be free to everyone, would those required to pay actually enrol?
    The research was something the centre’s ex-bookkeeper would have enjoyed doing and done well, not him. He received no complaint from the adult learning
    service at what he presented, though he was embarrassed by it and couldn’t imagine it being of any value to the ELSFA or anyone else.
    After the research now something seriously worrying. Even though the charity’s contract with, ultimately, the ELSFA still had two years to run, there was to be
    a competition between local providers running similar adult learning courses.
    It was completely new and confusing, contrary to all previous ELSFA practice. Two adult learning providers weren’t affected at all as they ran specialist
    courses. Among the five that were, three focused on mainstream provision, the other two, including the centre, students unlikely to enrol at a mainstream
    provider, or certainly not first time around. The two “locals” were intentionally well apart.
    These two were specialists in their own right and encouraged their graduates to progress to the mainstream providers once they’d gained the confidence to do
    so if they wished to progress. Here at this centre, students also had immediate access to its two employability support services. Years of successful
    straightforward working together, now sudden competitors for no apparent reason, the charity on its third contract improving with each.
    At the same time, he was drafting a job description for an adult learning quality assurance position to start in the autumn, the post long promised to the adult
    learning service yet never delivered for lack of funding. The Head of Adult Learning was advising him and would be a member of the interview panel.
    The competition was to be in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, complex as referred to at a special training event. Though however complex it might be, it was
    trivial in comparison with the main ELSFA application that always took him several days.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Corporate Interference</strong><br>
     Yet Again Now back to his struggle with his
    supervision overdose. Due to it, he’d mentioned the competition to his line-manager who offered to help with the spreadsheet. He’d said “no thank you” for five
    reasons, straightforward as far as he was concerned though apparently not to the corporate as later on.
    To accept his line-manager’s offer would mean having to provide a full briefing on the centre’s entire adult learning programme. His line-manager had already missed the special spreadsheet training event. The only time he had for such detailed work was at the weekend when the centre was less demanding, while
    he was supposed to be working only 28 days a week. Even more critical to him, he would have to explain me, what it meant to have a hemi and how he had to
    work around me, why he worked very much slower than his line-manager. He feared misunderstandings or worse. Soon after he started at the centre, he’d
    accepted some other assistance from the corporate and ended up having to start again once the assistance had left.
    In addition and much the most important, he already had help from someone who knew the centre’s adult learning programme as well as he did and had also
    attended the spreadsheet training. It came from the centre’s adult learning administrator responsible for course returns, with the centre for more than four
    years, partner of one of the I.T. tutors. And something happened when they completed the spreadsheet that surprised and reassured him. For some reason
    that happened elsewhere, the administrator was short in confidence. So, when he asked the administrator’s thoughts on the application, the answer wasn’t the
    cautious response he’d expected, rather a highly enthusiastic one - partners, no longer employer and employee.
  </p>
    <p>
    Email Hemi Extension Trap<br>
     It was the complete opposite when
    he asked the adult learning administrator to take over from the ex-bookkeeper by receiving copies of his non-private emails. The answer was an embarrassed
    “no”. He considered asking the new centre administrator, yet there was still a confidence gap needing to be filled. As a result, he didn’t notice the email
    extension that arrived with the spreadsheet.
    It was crazy he hadn’t triple checked every email extension, especially after his previous experience even if by then eight years ago. Utterly irresponsible at
    any time, now this......The only excuse, not that there could be one, was the stress and exhaustion he’d been under for so long.
    
    As he’d assumed there would be some form of backup, he provided his own. It was five or six pages against the adult learning service’s one when he finally
    found it. It included all the information the adult learn service had known for years and the help the Head of Adult Learning was providing with the job
    description for the new adult learning post added.
    Then he remembered what had happened with the most recent mainstream nationwide adult learning contract application. The old and the new Heads of Adult
    Learning had called him in as they thought he’d made a mistake with one of the sections. In fact, it wasn’t the case. However, the point was the precedent. The
    Head who’d just spent so much time working with him had a precedent for intervening again if something seemed odd. He received no call.
    The adult learning service, like his corporate line-managers, was aware of me, that he was disabled. Though as always, he never appeared or behaved as if
    he was.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Fate Hidden Game Appearing</strong><br>
     He hadn’t completely forgotten
    the weird idea of the autumn that local politicians of the party in power were planning to use the fraud as an excuse to get the centre closed. After working out
    then that, should anything ever happen, it wouldn’t till now, he wasn’t surprised to find himself at a meeting with the local authority’s lead officer responsible for
    reporting on it.
    Also present a bit surprisingly were the Head of Adult Learning and his seventh and final line-manager, along with the Chair of the charity and one other member of the charity’s Board. Yes, he understood the reason for the Head’s presence given the importance of the charity’s contract with the adult learning
    service. No, he didn’t understand his line-manager’s presence as the corporate had nothing to do with either the charity or the charity’s adult learning contract.
    He can’t remember much of what the lead officer said. How seriously the local authority considered the fraud. There would be no recommendation in the lead
    officer’s report, the decision entirely political. He knew the party in power prided itself in its local decision making and that the local politicians hardly ever used
    the centre unlike the local M.P. who did so every month.
    No one present asked why had it taken the lead officer so long to arrange a meeting on a matter, in the view of the local authority, was so important. By now,
    the fraud had been known for a year. Equally or even more to the point, the local authority hadn’t lost anything itself. In that sense, dealing with the fraud was a
    private matter being addressed in line with the Charity Commissioners’ requirements. There might even be justified criticism of the local politicians in power at
    the way they were dealing with the matter.
    After the officers left, those remaining thought the meeting had gone reasonably well. He was beyond considering it, just holding on for whatever came next.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Local Politics Takes Over</strong><br>
     Shortly after, another meeting that was
    late. It was open to anyone, the Chair of the charity reporting on the fraud and what had been happening since. The Chair was good at such meetings, though
    as to be expected made no reference to the TUPE Queen of London and the performance of the corporate. Otherwise, everything went well. The ex-Treasurer
    attended, its loan already re-paid, and the Chair answered the ex-Treasurer’s questions quietly and in full, with none of the game playing he’d feared.
    Then fate used one of the local politicians of the party in power to ask the final question. The Chair’s approach immediately changed, returning to local politics.
    No detailed answer was offered, instead telling the local politician where to find the answer for themself.
    After the meeting the Chair refused to acknowledge what had happened. So, he told the local politician he would send on the information requested, though he
    knew that hadn’t been the point. Not that he was as disturbed as he might have been. Once again, just one more of everything else and already waiting for the
    next.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Check-Fate</strong><br>
     A couple of days later Bergman finished the
    film, the Chair of the charity playing Death as the fuse finally blew.
    It was a Thursday afternoon in early July, a year after he’d discovered the fraud, three and a half years since it’d been agreed that his position was impossible.
    The Chair of the charity had just come from a meeting with the same Director of the corporate who’d dismissed TUPE and reneged on the agreement, till
    recently the two in opposite sides with him holding everything together.
    The Chair informed him his adult learning application had failed, and failed to such an extent the adult learning contract had already been terminated with no
    suggestion of any form of appeal. The Chair referred to some figures, perhaps three out of 80. Presumably not precise, yet certainly something immense. And
    somehow his own support paper with the spreadsheet and the correct paper had been different. Yet they’d both said the same year after year - not that it mattered any more.
    It was completely over. He’d failed everyone, tutors, staff, users, everyone and everything utterly. No thought at all about his years of living the impossible with
    the corporate. It was him alone and his failure. Again, years at it. Now this in an instant. It was time to go. The Chair agreed. He’d no longer any right to
    remain.
    It was one of those moments when two minds struggled with each other. Blankness, shame, dismay. Yet at the same time there was something not right, didn’t make sense – submitting an adult learning application to the Head of Adult Learning as always, the result being delivered to the Chair of the charity in
    conjunction with the same Director of the corporate. Again, not that it mattered any more.
    His head was on his desk. As soon as the Chair of the charity left, he raised it. Melodrama. He’d never behaved that way before. He got going again as if
    nothing had happened.
    That night he had his best sleep for goodness knows how long. The burden of his impossible position year after year was over and he hadn’t had time yet to
    wheel in the replacement. He turned up early next morning as usual, had a successful meeting, then headed to HR.
    HR gave him two options to consider over the weekend – be gagged from saying anything critical of the corporate for £4,000 and a reference, or the sack. He
    was then given half an hour at the centre to collect his belongings, then his line-manager would come to escort him away.
  </p>
    <p>
    Destructively Absurd<br>
     He was surprised he’d been allowed back
    unsupervised. Imagine what he might have stolen or even caused a commotion? Though hardly likely after his performance at his disciplinary and over the
    years.
    His line-manager was punctual as to be expected, playing the role of illegal immigrant removal officer except it was broad daylight instead of clandestinely
    early in the morning. Fortunately, it seemed no one noticed his leaving. Unsurprisingly, he remembered the Matrix Standard award of a year ago that confirmed
    everyone at the centre felt safe - except for him.
    Now the final reminder of the ridiculousness of it all, or perhaps there would be two more at the very end. As soon as he parted company with his line- manager, he returned to the centre to write a debriefing report for the Chair of the charity. Habit again, including habit on the part of the Chair expecting it.
    He went back to the centre over the weekend. More habit and with nothing else to do. He took away papers to support a major complaint that in the end he
    never sent. He left his set of keys in the post box – when the corporate opened the centre, it got the address wrong and took months to put it right.
  </p>

    <h3>Cost of a Hemi</h3>
    <p>
    <strong>HR Stumped – for a Moment</strong><br>
    
    Monday was decision day – the deal or the sack.
    There was no way he could accept the offer. That would be betrayal of himself. Though easy to say as he could now claim his pension and avoid any need for
    a corporate reference. Goodness knows what would he have done had it not been the case?
    Being sacked was what he wanted, the only way he could express his feelings, not that anyone would take any notice or even be aware. Except he’d spent all
    his working life running centres where the pay was always poor and only this last one offered a pension, so small he hadn’t taken it. There’d still been no mention of his having to retire and he’d bills to pay. So, he did what even HR couldn’t stop him from doing, go long term sick leave like everyone else working
    for the corporate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Disgust and Disgrace</strong><br>
     He’d been holding himself
    together reasonably well, the enormity of it all still to fully sink in. Till he went to see a G.P. for HR’s sick note.
    His sick leave history had been excellent except for the abscess and a handful of other hospital stays, all brief. The corporate allowed one to three months off
    for a hip operation. He’d had two and after each went back to work the day after his discharge. He was working for the charity, not the corporate. He’d done the
    same with his other hospital stays. A record he’d been quietly proud of and wished others would perform in a similar way.
    The G.P. asked him to fill in something new to him, a depression score. Depression? It was something he’d never associated himself with, even questioning
    others who were. He can’t remember his score, unlikely 23 out of 26, though something as extreme as his adult learning application failure. Was he cheating in
    some way to make certain he got his sick note?
    As he walked away from the surgery, the enormity of it all finally hit. Now on top of his centre destruction, he was using long term sick leave for money while
    tutors and staff were losing their jobs. He remembered Judas Iscariot in the Bible and what had happened to him?
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>“Timelessness” Returns to Remind His Unpaid Debt</strong><br>
     In the daytime his mind was stressfully numb. At night “timelessness” of Paradise Lost 1 returned, all the way from his tiny South Pacific home. He’d never been able to share
    it with anyone. No one could possibly understand its meaning to him. And since then, it’d never been far away.
    Especially now, he remembered the islanders who had nothing. Then the unknown friends who’d got him to Australia. The doctor who’d diagnosed what was
    wrong with him using almost nothing. His mother who’d come all the way to Australia and, if she hadn’t, he’d have stayed and been dead a few days later. His
    consultant there who knew another Australian consultant who’d just been headhunted by the Royal London Hospital.
    Finally, the miracle that G.Ps. were still responsible for their own “out of hours” calls and a stranger on a Sunday evening negotiated with “the London” 75 minutes away for the first of his six medical masterclass operations early next morning that started turning him around. Now this. None of his debt had been
    paid.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What Was It That Made It So Bad?</strong><br>
     Before, there’d never been enough hours in the
    day, now vastly too many. For years he’d seen something like 200 people a day, some only once, others for a time, yet others more like long term friends.
    Perhaps 5,000 centre users a year. One of his line-managers referred to a footfall of 25,000. Now literally no one.
    He hadn’t even been able to say goodbye to anyone. Though probably best that way due to what he’d done to them. Completely destroying the bond between
    tutors and staff that had made the centre so successful.
    At least a card from the charity’s Board, some members he’d known throughout. Though he’d heard that no one could contact him as he was considered under
    a corporate disciplinary once again. Yet the charity was supposed to be independent.
    The adult learning service? Again, nothing and with no sense of explanation. Many of the officers and the other service providers had known him for years as
    well, good working colleagues, some more like friends. If anything new was to be tested, it was always the centre that came forward. And on the odd occasion
    a provider lost their contract, always a card from all the others - except for him. Or perhaps it was too late for the July monthly meeting to organise one and
    there wouldn't be a meeting in August. He’d have to wait till September, though by then he’d long given up.
    Most disturbing of all was the response of the Head of Adult Learning, one of his long time colleagues, indeed as good as a friend. Applications had always
    been the Head’s responsibility, the strange final one as well. The standard practice after a contract failure – phone call, meeting, explanation, regret,
    appreciation, best of luck. Unpleasant, yet professional decency that the Head always followed as he well knew – except for him. What had he done that had
    been so bad?
    On top of it, immediately after he left the G.P. surgery to get his sick note, he’d seen the Head of Adult Learning striding to the tube. Striding was the correct
    word as the Head was tall and striking, someone not to go unnoticed in any crowd. Even more so when the Head bent down as if picking up something from
    the pavement without slowing down. Again, what had he done that had been so bad?
    After that, he started walking in other directions to get to wherever he was going as he lived not far away, very helpful till now. As a result, he bumped into the
    streetsweeper who used to drop in at the centre for tea. He couldn’t cope. He said nothing. He cried as he hurried away.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Therapist’s Would, Wouldn’t They</strong><br>
     Wasn’t it nothing more than
    melodrama? At least the corporate’s therapist didn’t think so, though it was the job of therapists to understand. As a corporate employee suffering from
    depression, apparently even one waiting to be sacked, he had to see one. So formal, the clock and box of tissues. Eight sessions, then an extra six. Where the
    extras really for him as he had so little to say, though that was unfair on the therapist? At least the sessions kept him engaged in his old world however
    disturbingly.
    The sessions were close to London Bridge. His bus stop for his return was close to the bridge itself and bridges could be involved in suicide, jumping one of
    his preferred ways out, though railway bridges for fear of his bobbing up again - imagine if he'd changed his mind?
    HR kept on requiring sick notes. On one occasion he was prescribed depression pills even though he knew he'd never take them. It would ultimately be too much. He’d fought to avoid taking epilepsy pills after his abscess as they have an influence on his brain. At least they’re for a medical purpose, not due to his
    being unable to cope with himself.
    He also went to a therapist via his G.P. service, more basic than the corporate’s. He only went as a means to some employment advice. The advice was three
    websites. Very good. Except they confirmed he was unemployable – his age, his hemi computer phobia, his unknown problem with letters, words and
    numbers, and me.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Going Through the Motions</strong><br>
     ACAS, the employment arbitration
    service? The person at the other end of the phone suggested the corporate had done nothing wrong in law in the way it had treated him. He didn’t argue. His
    slight hesitation when starting to say something had returned due to the abscess. A face to face meeting would have been more useful. Though he was only
    going through the motions. He’d long lost any belief in himself. TUPE? Incredible. He’d forgotten. It was as if it belonged somewhere else.
    He tried free legal advice when he did remember, like he’d done for the charity when he found the TUPE Queen of London. He was told TUPE was too
    complex for such a service as an individual. Yet all he wanted was confirmation or otherwise of the Queen of London’s firmly expressed view.
    TUPE and Personal Injury? A good case, except it would cost upfront. He studied law books in the library without success, unable to find a case when an
    employer wanted to retain control of staff from their new employer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Finally the Sack</strong><br>
     With his six months sick leave over, it
    was time for him to be formally sacked. Goodness knows why he attended? Something to do with the way he’d been brought up.
    He’d a vague idea that HR had to come up with three new justifications for what it was about to do and couldn’t simply continue to rely on the fraud. If that was
    the case, he could only remember two. They completed the succession of ridiculous impossibilities he’d had to endure all along.
    By then, it was 18 months since he’d asked for some funding for Excel training and nine months since he’d had to run around to the corporate’s two medical
    assessors. Apparently, a month or so later he was awarded £500 yet complained it wasn’t the case.
    Which was disturbingly absurd. He’d never done anything like it anywhere. And how could someone who’d absorbed everything that had been thrown at him
    by the corporate for all those years, fallen over backwards at his disciplinary, in between become someone else, something provocative as if wanting to wind
    up for a fight? His entire life had been about avoiding disturbance. That was why he’d ended up like this.
    The second justification for sacking him was his turning down his line-manager’s offer of help with the adult learning application, the reason why he went into
    such detail earlier on.
    Once again, he could have challenged HR, including introducing me. Once again, he didn’t.
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Suicide?</strong> <br>
    After being sacked, life got worse if that
    meant anything. Before, he was still connected however disturbingly, now completely out on his own, giving him even more time to remember Paradise Lost 1,
    what they’d done for him which had allowed him to still be here. Now what had he done in return?
    His complaint to the corporate he was preparing got longer and longer as he remembered more and more. It couldn’t help but show that the corporate had
    been as guilty as he was, ever increasingly so. Before long, it would be sent to the coroner.
    He was saved more than anyone by “mum”. The vet had given her that summer as her last and nearly completed another four. She’s hemi image 15 in the main hemi story.
  </p>
  <h3>Fate’s Conspiracy Theory</h3>
    <p>
    
    Like with the other hemi stories, fate had been enjoying itself so much it didn’t want to stop. So, it came up with a conspiracy theory to entertain itself.
    During the summer the forest had been hiding its trees through the leaves of their branches. This included a huge tree and a stumpy one close by. The stumpy
    tree was short of leaves and sturdy branches due to the huge tree.
    As the leaves started to fall in the autumn, the stumpy tree became more apparent. By the time winter arrived, it was now the stumpy tree that dominated, the
    huge tree too tall to be noticed, almost as if it was no longer there.
    Besides everything additional in what became the final year of the centre due to the fraud, he was still fully focused on the charity’s adult learning contract.
    After so many years working on it, it had become instinctive, the charity’s success mirroring that of the adult learning service.
    Though the sudden requirements of the ELSFA were certainly odd, indeed disturbing. Besides being unexpected, the application he had to submitted was in
    the form of a competition between long term colleague providers and using nothing more than a spreadsheet however complex and a one page backup paper.
    Nothing more as against the six stages of the traditional ELSFA nationwide application with its due-diligence section and legal status, yet with no power to
    instantly terminate the charity’s existing adult learning contract with another full year to run. There’d been nothing like this before.
    Odder, it’d been the Chair of the charity, not the Head of Adult Learning whose job included responsibility for adult learning applications and contracts, who’d
    informed him of his application’s utter failure and therefore expectation of his immediate depart with no right of appeal. The Chair had informed him of a meeting just before with the Director of the corporate, the one who’d reneged on the corporate’s formal agreement with the charity to implement TUPE seven
    years fate. He was never to have any further dealings with the Head except when trying to avoid being seen by him on the way to the tube.
    Equally the local authority’s lead officer responsible for reporting on the fraud after organising the special meeting to empathise that the local authority’s
    decision on the charity’s fraud would be taken politically. Yet there’d been no report, only the failed adult learning application that was nothing to do with
    politicians. He called the lead officer later, left a message, received no reply. Try again and the lead officer no longer worked for the local authority.
    And there’d been the open meeting on the charity’s response to the fraud, when the Chair of the charity sparred with the local politician of the party in power,
    the Chair not long ago a local politician of the party then in power, their disagreement in no way related to the centre.
    With all the leaves of the branches fallen, it had become fully apparent that the stumpy tree was an evergreen, while the huge tree had become diseased and
    would have to be felled. It seemed the local politicians in power had decided, contrary to the advice of their officers, to use an adult learning process planned
    nine months earlier to get the charity closed, not a political process after all, and with the connivance of the corporate that would no longer have to pay
    anything towards the centre it had used to take over the area. The Chair of the charity? The centre’s closure the easiest way to take revenge on something
    that happened when the Chair had been politically in power.

  <h3>The End – At Least for the Moment </h3>
<p>
    Nothing more than a conspiracy theory?
    Fate had enjoyed it so much that it still couldn’t stop. Forty months after the Chair of the charity had as good as sacked him on the spot, he was walking with a
    friend beside the Brixton Recreation Centre. They were about to turn to the left passed a local authority office block.
    As they did, he noticed a tall and striking figure approaching. He immediately forgot the tall and striking figure disappearing away on my right hemi blank side
    as if heading straight ahead.
    Then his friend asked him why was the tall and striking figure trying to avoid him, keeping well away on my right hemi blank side when turning towards the
    office block on his left? He was just in time to see the Head of Adult Learning once again. If it hadn’t been for me and my right hemi blank side, this time the
    Head of Adult Learning would have been unable to avoid him. And if he didn’t have a hemi, a disability, once again nothing would ever have happened.
