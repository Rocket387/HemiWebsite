<h2>Beyond the Scan</h2>

<h3>Medical Masterclass</h3>

<p>
If we haven’t met before, a very warm welcome. If we have, a very warm welcome back.
This is one of four hemi stories. It isn’t, in fact, much about me, a <italic>right homonymous hemianopia</italic>. Rather, it’s
about the two conditions that walked out of the Royal London Hospital with him and me miraculously brain
abscess free. I call them <italic>my epilepsy</italic> and <italic>my rewiring hemi companions</italic>. 30 years on <italic>my right ear loss hemi
companion</italic> joined us as well. It all started more than 50 years ago.
</p>
<h3>His Friendly Connection</h3>
<p>

He experienced six medical masterclasses under Mr T.T. King and his team to turn him around after three
unsuccessful attempts shortly before – and before that, a 14 days journey from a tiny island in the South Pacific
without any form of medical assistance.
</p>
<p>
After masterclass operation 1, he was unable to communicate. He could understand as before, yet anything he
attempted himself came out as nonsense. That’s except for first thing in the morning and in the afternoon if he’d
been asleep, he managed three syllables left over from his island home.
</p>
<p>
He could do so four times over 10 minutes or so. If he said them too quickly, added something, or tried
something entirely on its own, his connection immediately cut out as if in anger. Say the syllables more slowly
than usual, he would lose the final three. However, this time his connection wasn’t angry, as if saying “goodbye”
and “see you again” as in the regular way.
</p>
<p>
Only once over nearly two months did the connection fail to returned, neither in the morning or in the afternoon. It
was a bad day. He hadn’t realised how important even this briefest of connection had become. It made him feel
as if he was still engaged. Now no longer. He was entirely on his own. He started thinking of people thought to be
brain dead and aren’t. Except he wasn’t. His connection returned the following morning as if nothing had
happened.
</p>
<p>
His connection reminded him of an elderly battery. Charged overnight it came across clearer and for longer than
in the afternoon as if the recharge time available hadn’t been enough. He wanted to share his friend, in part for
confirmation. However, he lacked the words required to do so.
</p>
<p>
He felt sad not being able to say “thank you” and “goodbye” after masterclass 4 switched on his reconfigured
wiring. For him, the connection was entirely real and he would still like to know what it was all about? Perhaps a
connection with the strange ways his brain will start performing later on.
</p>

<h3>Moving On</h3>
<p>
His <italic>rewiring</italic> recovery was gradual yet sure after operation 4. It saved him from Jack and Jill Book 2 that was
trying to help him communicate again. He was told a 98% recovery after two years. Such precision would have
seemed ridiculous had he not met Mr King. Or perhaps 99% in 21 months.
</p>
<p>
He remembers little of his recovery other than steady improvement. A bit odd to find himself back at university
within a couple of months. Fortunately, his course was undemanding unlike his previous one, and for a time a
fellow student somehow understood what he wanted to say better than he did. He enjoyed prime colours plus
green as he never knew which would come next. All the other colours felt limp, black and white immediately
dismissed.
</p>
<p>
His only notable difficulty after recovery had been when starting to say something or finish, with no problem in
between. He knew what he wanted to say, the first word came out as required, the next three or four had already
disappeared. Which came to become a game he was good at, finding instant replacements to words he’d
instantly forgotten. Quite how he doesn’t know. He wasn’t so good when finishing, sometimes hesitating,
occasionally drying up.
</p>
<p>
Safely away from university, he never considered <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic> and me as being employment
obstacles. He never considered himself disabled, naturally no one aware of what was going on inside him. For a
time he had a job that flew him to such places as Haiti and Gaza, always on his own and without any thought of
something going wrong including his epilepsy.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably he no longer read the paper from end to end, though that had been an unnecessary habit and, anyway,
he had the radio as an alternative. His <italic>half-eyes tortoise speed reading</italic> was good enough for any basic office
work required including two fingers typing. There was nothing to suggest he might have problems with letters,
words and numbers.
</p>
<p>
He didn’t find anyone or anything to tell him he mustn’t drive, therefore did with perfect ease for two years outside
London, a right wingmirror covering <italic>my right hemi blank side</italic>. Cycling in London, however, was foolish as he
instinctively kept to the fast lane, seeing far more than on the slow lane though not quite enough.
</p>
<p>
Then for 10 years he could as good as forget about me. Fate landed him with another of his rescue jobs, this
time cooking day and night in a <italic>hemi perfect kitchen</italic> instead of a community centre. As to be expected, no one
had ever heard of a <italic>hemi</italic> and he was still so <italic>hemi ignorant</italic> it took him another 10 years to realise that, if I’d been
a <italic>left hemi</italic>, he’d have hardly seen the stove.
</p>
<p>
However, there’d been a pointer to the future. He did his best to avoid using the till, even more so a calculator.
He could see a single column of digits in the calculator’s weird order, then another, now a third, a fourth he could
ignore. One moment all the digits, then a single column again.
</p>
<p>
He was immensely relieved to be out of the kitchen, yet regretted it at the same time. Over his 10 years <italic>hemi
holiday</italic>, computers had taken over the world and he’d been left behind. His calculator was a warning of what was
to come.
</p>

<h3>“The Watershed”</h3>
<p>
Then 30 years after his abscess, three things happened that were worrying on their own and might be
interrelated. He hadn’t had an epileptic fit for coming up to 10 years when he had one out of the blue. One night
he lost all his hearing in his right ear as instantly and completely as <italic>my right hemi blank side</italic>. At a public meeting,
he said £500,000 instead of £300,000 and denied it.
</p>
<p>
He’d already had an immense amount of borrowed time and the life expectancy of a reconditioned car is always
shorter than a car with a clean record. Yet a scan found nothing. Therefore he’s treating the “three watershed
conditions” separately, <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic> still unexplained.
</p>
<h3>My Epilepsy Hemi Companion</h3>
<p>
He’s what he calls three forms of fit – “standard”, “mini” and something he doesn’t know.
</p>
<p></p>
<italic>“Standard Fits” </italic>
<br>
His “standard fit” experience is in three parts, before “the watershed”, his fits returning, disappearing again.
</p>
<p>
Part one was also in three parts, testing the strength of his pills requirement, having fits, then their first
disappearance. He’d fought taking any. Having an abscess was nothing in comparison. Pills meant he’d lost
control and was no longer whoever he used to be. And to an extent he was correct as he’ll be coming to shortly.
</p>
<p>

In the end he settled down with two pills twice a day. His fits weren’t frequent, perhaps no more two a year,
always at night. There were no side effects other than annoyance. Then they stopped. For a time he hadn’t
realised, perhaps eight years after they’d started. He continued taking the pills as by then he took them for
granted. Presumably, the lack of fits meant they were doing their job.
</p>
<p>
For a reason unrelated to his epilepsy, he spent a few days in hospital. A doctor, not a neurologist, was horrified
at his still taking the pills and said in a manner he’d never medically experienced before that he should stop.
</p>
<p>
It left him feeling uneasy. He would have liked some advice, yet didn’t know where to turn for it. And, of course, it
was easier to stop than continue. Nothing happened when he did, no new “standard fits”. The doctor had indeed
been right.
</p>
<p>
Nothing appeared to have happened to encourage the return of his “standard fits” 30 years after his abscess.
Once again, they weren’t frequent, much the same as before and with no side effects. Except now they were
during the daytime and often in inappropriate places – twice in a swimming pool, a multi-stage road crossing he
hadn’t wanted to use, smashing his head on the pavement early in the morning when no one was about.
Fortunately, the infrequency of his fits and his “no big deal” approach to me (see <italic>Paradise Lost 1</italic>) allowed him to
continue as previously.
</p>
<p>
Then the “standard fits” stopped once again, the most recent probably 15 years ago or longer. This time he’s still
taking his pills.
</p>
<p>
<italic>“Mini-Fits” </italic>
<br>
The first of his two types of “mini-fit” came alive soon after the end – that’s till now - of his “standard fits”. The “mini-
fits” always happened when he was drying after a swim – the centre had allowed him to continue swimming even

after his two “standard fits” there. His right arm froze, he sat down if standing, nothing else happened other than
his knowing he’d be unable to respond if someone spoke to him. He simply waited for a moment or two, his arm
relaxed, he continued as before.
</p>
<p>
He probably had five or six “mini-fits” of this type, perhaps a few more. He wondered whether they were
influenced by his level of swimming effort, though he never slowed. They didn’t return after he’d had two hip
operations and been forced to swim differently.
</p>
<p>
These “mini-fits” reminded him of what happened immediately before his first “standard fit” that took him to “the
London”. He was having a bath, a particularly hot one as he was feeling cold. He’d asked his right hand to
transfer the soap to his left hand as usual. Except his right hand refused, relenting only at his fourth attempt.
Though none of these more recent “mini-fits” triggered anything more.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the first type of “mini-fits”, the second has been unpleasant, tending to start that way and easing or the
other way around. He’s been sitting at his laptop, always at the start of a new line. He becomes aware that
something’s about to happen, tries to keep working, then has to accept that a force has taken over. He promises
to remember what will happen next as he loses awareness, yet never succeeds other than a sense of something
similar to what he's just been doing.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, he’s waiting for himself outside. Till he finds himself back at his laptop ready to get going again, then
realises the force still has control. The force starts to leave with an intense pressure. He tries once more as the
force works itself into a crescendo, then disappears. It takes him some time to recover.
</p>
<p>
He’s probably had 15 such “mini-fits”, on two occasions three in the same day that became extremely
unpleasant. He now hasn’t had one for seven or eight years, yet they’re nasty enough for him not to say they’re
over for fear of their return.
</p>
<p>
<italic>Is This Also Epilepsy? </italic>
<br>
The two “mini-fits” seem a junior version of “standard fits”, both very different from what he experienced during three
neurology outpatient appointments after the return of his fits and a fourth several years later.
</p>
<p>
He was lying on his consultant’s couch ready for his reflexes to be tested, the consultant using a kind of tuning
fork exactly the same as Mr King’s 30 years earlier. Except then, his legs responded to Mr King’s requests
without giving them any thought – both consultants “requesting” rather than “requiring”. Yet while both
consultants most likely assumed it would be the case, now his legs refused to agree, perhaps much the same as
when his right hand wouldn’t give over the soap to his left hand. He knew exactly what was being requested of
them on every appointment, practicing in advance after his first failure. Yet the result was always the same.
</p>
<p>
Highly embarrassing, though perhaps the consultant hadn’t noticed. The movements requested were so slight
that the consultant must have built up a momentum that moved his legs for him. Though that was more likely
wishful thinking on his part, the consultant just being polite. Whichever, his embarrassment was such that he
never asked why it was happening.
The fourth appointment was five or so years later. His G.P. had booked it in error. The hospital was different, the
consultant was different, and both the consultant and he knew they were merely going through the motions.
Regardless, he failed once again.
</p>
<p>
Since then and out of curiosity, he’s tried to test himself when seeing a G.P. or having an x-ray. On one or two
occasions just possibly a similarity, otherwise not at all. Though at the time of “the watershed”, these incidents
were of his greatest concern – what’s to happen next?
</p>
<p>
Back to pills again after the return of his “standard fits”. These pills were different, one twice a day rather than two
twice a day. On one occasion his postal repeat prescription had been delayed. Four pills-free days led to his
functioning at supercharge to the extent he couldn’t possibly not notice. Which meant that indeed his pills had
taken over, he wasn’t quite the person he’d been. At least he now takes a pill that, as he was advised, has less
side effect than the other, though not quite as effective. Not what it seems to matter with him......at least till now.
</p>

<h3>Right Ear Loss</h3>
<p>
The second of “the watershed trio” is the one that’s not directly part of his brain.
</p>
<p>
He’d just come back from a run and was trying to shake water from his right ear as sometimes after a swim,
except he hadn’t been swimming that night. The annoyance continued for four days, gradually easing. That night
it seemed as if it’d been raining hard throughout, though it hadn’t. It continued for years, only very gradually
decreasing. Next morning on his way to work it seemed he was drunk, his balance gone. It continued for 20 days
then stopped, a day earlier than he’d been advised. Though his hearing had gone never to return, the loss as
complete as <italic>my right hemi blank side</italic>.
</p>
<p>
He was told he had antiphospholopid syndrome and most people have it only in their lower body like having
swollen legs. He was horrified at the thought of it and felt immensely relieved he had it upstairs as well as down,
only later realising the far greater risk involved with his ear so close to his brain. It was then that he was shown
an x-ray of his brain with its left brain moved across to join his right brain.
</p>
<p>
There was an inevitable period of adjustment to this hearing loss, more intense than for me. It was only then that
he realised how important his right ear had been in protecting him from <italic>my right hemi blank side</italic>. It had provided
a split-second sensation before otherwise a <italic>hemi bump</italic>. It was then that he went over a car, fate playing “good
guy” as he picked himself up from the road, apologised to the bewildered driver and walked away.
</p>
<p>
More to the point with fate still playing “good guy”, it had given him a right blank ear. Had it been his left ear, his
life would have been unpleasant, constantly aware that something was wrong on one side or the other. As it is,
his only relating problem is being unable to work out from which direction sound is coming - voices, phones,
alarms, police cars.
</p>
<p>
Years on, his G.P. notes told him he’d had a stroke. Which confused him. Thank goodness he hadn’t been told at
the time.
</p>

<h3>My Rewiring Hemi Companion</h3>
<p>
It was the third of “the watershed trio” that caused him the greatest concern after his reflex performances. It was
for three reasons – his £500,000 against £300,000 mistake then denial; while the other two conditions were
instantly acknowledged medically, this one wasn’t and still hasn’t; as a moment or two ago, what’s to happen
next?
</p>
<p>
He started trying to test whether the incident had been a “one off” or not, if “yes” was it numbers alone or letters
and words as well. He tried to test himself when reading at night. It wasn’t easy to assess. What did seem
apparent, however, was that he now had a problem he hadn’t before.
</p>
<p>
And it was numbers that were giving him the greatest concern. Reading and writing, letter and word mistakes
could be sorted, just a bit more frustratingly timewasting. Not so numbers.
</p>
<p>
Given that “the watershed” was a trio and his medical record, he was given a scan that found nothing. Relief,
though not complete. He had no idea how a scan could confirm or otherwise he was making mistakes or not,
mistakes he’d never made before.
</p>
<p>
So, what to do? And again, easier to do nothing than bother the NHS any further. As always, he’d had the best
possible health check. Almost rude to seek anything more. Except he was still making mistakes and had
responsibilities. He had to be prepared for whatever might happen next after all that had happened in the past.
And a repeat of his £200,000 public mistake would see him out of a job.
</p>

<h3>The Psychologist</h3>
<p>
Now something only fate could have conjured up. I hesitated including it as it’s critical. Except it’s yet another of
fate’s “impossibles”, never possible to happen to anyone else, as good as never happening for real.
</p>
<p>
If he wanted to take his third “watershed concern” further, his consultant would refer him to a psychologist.
By doing an annual intelligence test, it would be possible to determine whether his <italic>rewiring</italic> had been fraying
further. The consultant warned him that the experience might be unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This confused him</strong>. Why and how? He’d never imagined seeing a psychologist for any reason. And his abscess
had been medical, its side effects medical......or, since his scan had found nothing wrong medically, might the
consultant be wondering whether his letter, word and number mistakes were real or not?
</p>
<p>
Though he hardly believed it to be the case, preferring to image the consultant and the psychologist would be
working with him to determine his mistakes. And if the test was unpleasant in some way, presumably it meant it
would be doing its job. Anyway, the first test would be nothing more than a benchmark for the following years.
</p>
<p>
Now his first appointment. A large building, unwelcoming, seemingly empty, mentally cold, ideal for a horror story,
the psychologist playing the lead, the script starting with an offer of pills.
</p>
<p>
Pills? What pills? All he could think of was illicit pills. He was disgusted, and with the psychologist as cold as the
building itself.
</p>
<p>
He was offered pills again and the penny dropped. Depression pills. Yet he’d come for an intelligence test, not a
quick fix and away. He was offered pills for a final time at the end of the first of three weekly sessions, also being
asked whether he would be returning?
</p>
<p>
Certainly not after what he’d already experienced and he suspected the psychologist didn’t want to see him back
as well. Except, yet again, he’d come for an intelligence test.
</p>
<p>
And surely the psychologist wouldn’t be invigilating what was to be a tick-box form of test. In addition, if the test
was to be a standard one, nothing special for <italic>hemis</italic>, would the psychologist be making any allowance for me as
he’d be working against a clock?
</p>
<p>
In the end he didn’t ask any questions. It would have been taken as a challenge, while all he’d come for was the
start of his annual intelligence test.
</p>
<p>
Now fate's entertainment, probably at its best. The final test completed and without referring to anything at all, the
psychologist told him he wasn’t as intelligent as he should have been given the university he’d attended.
</p>
<p>
He didn’t mind the insult as such. He’d never had any idea how he’d got there. Yet for a psychologist, any
psychologist and even more so one well into their 50s with all the airs of importance surrounded by formal family
photos......it was outrageous.
</p>
<p>
No reference was made to any test results and what was to follow. Years later and again discovered from his G.P.
notes, he found he’d been diagnosed as mildly depressed which his G.P. had clearly ignored.
</p>
<p>
He’d had no option but to complain. Months later it was the psychologist who phoned to tell him he could be
slotted in the following day due to a cancellation. That could easily have been taken as another insult and the
very last person he wanted to see was the psychologist.
</p>
<p>
He left it at that, putting the receiver down unanswered. The NHS had already done far more than enough for him
to take the psychologist’s behaviour any further. Though it meant the psychologist was free to perform in any
related way once again, not to forget anyone who’d been affected already, though surely it was so outrageous it
must be unique.
</p>

<h3>Numbers – Meter Reading</h3>
<p>
After such craziness, once again what to do next? Give up and hope that nothing else would emerge, or try to
find a way to monitor himself - would his mistakes increase, in what form if the answer was “yes”, and what would
be the implication?
</p>
<p>
The answer turned out to be immediate and as good as impossible once again. Fate arranged for him to be
made redundant one evening - nothing to do with <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic> or me. The only job it could find
for him in the local paper next morning was as a meter reader. Which was precisely the job he needed, checking
simple numbers all day.
</p>
<p>
The job was of the simplest. The hard work was finding the meter address, anyone at home, the meter itself. Once found, transfer
the four digits, occasionally five, on the meter dial to the meter reading device in his hand and away.
</p>
<p>
Except every third or fourth meter “read” he got a digit wrong. He seldom realised it immediately. A brief moment
of approval, then an awareness that something was wrong, soon wrong yet again, as if one of the digits had just
changed itself, most likely the second or third of four.
</p>
<p>
And it wasn’t a matter of doing another quick "read" and away. Rather, his <italic>half-eyes</italic> were now staring at the dial,
carefully monitoring the physical transfer of the digits from dial to device even more so than before, checking for
any unrealised movement along the way, confirming their successful arrival, then having to admit something had
gone wrong again.
</p>
<p>
Even more frustrating and also amazing, once he'd got a “read” wrong it could take him four or five further
attempts before he accepted that he’d got both dial and device the same three times. Not necessarily three times
in succession, that would have been too much to ask for. The psychologist would have been laughing all the
time.
</p>
<p>
He started taking a notebook with him to help. Except how could it? How could digits written in his notebook be
any more reliable than those in the device? And by then, could he really be certain the digits his <italic>half-eyes</italic> were
seeing on the dial be any more accurate than those in the other two?
</p>
<p>
It was uncanny, his mind ordering four digits of its own printer only to find that the printer had views of its own. No
rhyme or reason, good mornings and bad evenings, then the other way around, next the mistakes in good order
between right and wrong, something like 6,000 in total, as good or as bad at the beginning as at the end.
</p>

<h3>Numbers - Digital Camera to Laptop</h3>
<p>
He never imagined he’d find anything even vaguely related to meter reading in an attempt to compare “then” and
“now” as a stand-in for intelligence tests. That was till he bought a digital camera to help support the <italic>hemi main
story with hemi images</italic>. Even the key camera reference numbers are based on four digits, the same as for meter
reading.
</p>
<p>
Except the detail of transferring the four digits from a meter dial to a meter reading devise is very less demanding
than from a camera to a laptop. As a moment ago, for meter reading all his <italic>half-eyes</italic> had to do was lower
themselves from the dial to the device in his hand. Any further action required would always be to his left side,
not <italic>my right hemi blank side</italic>.
</p>
<p>
Now turn to his camera and the controls – like many others - are on my <italic>right hemi blank side</italic> so his <italic>half-eyes</italic>
can’t see them immediately. When his <italic>half-eyes</italic> have turned to me, they see a cluster of very small actions
required, with the four digits not the most immediately obvious. This only takes a moment, yet longer than for
meter reading.
</p>
<p>
Transfer to his laptop......or has it really been the case? From time to time his <italic>half-eyes</italic> and his mind confirm the
four digits ready to be transferred, yet are unknown on arrival. So, his <italic>half-eyes</italic> and his mind have to start again,
on occasion more than once.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, <italic>hemi image</italic> numbered positions, unlike when meter reading with no alternatives, may not
immediately be apparent. Perhaps they’re hiding in a cluster of <italic>hemi images</italic> or there’s a gap of a page or even
two before the next.
</p>
<p>
On top of it, his <italic>half-eyes</italic> and his mind have to contend with two <italic>hemi headaches</italic> most likely unique to <italic>right
hemis</italic> for which I’m responsible, not <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic>. First, there’s always the risk of his <italic>half-eyes</italic>
missing a numbered position if it’s at the far end of a line of text – the gap between seeing and not seeing is
nothing more than a single “blank” (see main <italic>Hemi Story</italic> p.p.13-109).
</p>
<p>
Though the real <italic>hemi headache’smy blank hole</italic>  (see main Hemi Story p.p.8-9). As his <italic>half-eyes</italic> search for the
next numbered position, they’re doing so at <italic>pre-hemi time and speed</italic>, that’s as if he still has full-eyes. Which
means his <italic>half-eyes</italic> are turning too fast back and forth to see the position if it’s somewhere in the middle of what
they’re looking for, that’s even though it’s been marked in bold in advance. Slow down to <italic>hemi time and speed</italic>
and the position will appear.
</p>
<p>
Back to <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic> and the problems it causes, “now” his mind frequently confuses 0 and 1 as
the first digit of a numbered position, or 1 and 2. Then after coping with the first digit, his mind may confuse two
of the three remaining digits, most likely 2 and 4. That’s besides coming up with something entirely different.
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, there’re the digits that never give his <italic>half-eyes</italic> any trouble and the ones that do. The latter do so
frequently and can be anticipated. And more recently, his half-eyes may watch his mind working on a new
number and at the same time allowing his <italic>half-eyes</italic> to continue with a number that’s already known to be a
mistake.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, while the differences between “then” and “now” are considerable, there’re clear similarities as
well. His notebook while meter reading and a special numbered positions file for camera/laptop transferring, each
expected to provide easier access to greater accuracy, then realising there’s no more chance of one than the
other and still neither might be correct. Again, when a mistake’s been acknowledged, it may well take several
further attempts to sort it out, even then without complete confidence.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, the transfer process between camera and laptop has been challenging against the simplicity of meter
reading and therefore justifies the major increase in mistakes since “then”. Yet it doesn’t mean an increase in the
proportion of mistakes caused by <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic>. Some have had nothing to do with it or of me as
he tries to improve his writing. Then there’re the mistakes I cause, such as when his <italic>half-eyes</italic> are having to
check mistakes working backwards.
</p>
<p>
So, this has been a longwinded way to compare “then” and “now”, only to find there’s probably been little change
over the 20 years or so since “the watershed”. Which means the psychologist did him an immense favour, saving
him from another intelligence test.
</p>

<h3>Letters and Words – Reading and Writing</h3>
<p>
At least numbered position mistakes are neat and orderly even when wrong. Not so letters and words.
</p>
<p>
He was writing a fair amount before “the watershed” and the increase in his mistakes after the £500,000 instead
of £300,000 wasn’t much of an extra nuisance. It was helped by his writing being largely on the same topic for
the same “audience”. “Now”, that’s by the completion of the <italic>hemi main story</italic>, writing’s also become a challenge.
It’s as if every word’s had to be tested, often rejected, quite likely brought back again though in a slightly different
way.
</p>
<p>
Many of his mistakes are due to me and have been shared in the <italic>hemi main story’s</italic> short-vision. Here in a
moment, examples of the creativity of his brain as it attempts to get a word correct, fails, yet provides evidence of
the effort it’s made.
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly again, “now” seems in better “mistake management order” since earlier after “the watershed”. They fit
more or less into 11 variables. Then, his mind included mistakes that appeared not to have any relevance to
anything other than being a word, or a word that was relevant to something a short time ago, or a word similar to
the required one though completely different, or occasionally a handful of letters that made nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
When his mind becomes aware of a mistake, it can usually correct it in a few moments, or soon after. Though
there’re occasions when he has to leave the mistake till the following morning knowing that it will no longer be a
problem. Fortunately, this is now seldom. This is suggesting that, while the number of his mistakes has
increased, there’s been an improvement in his mind’s attempts to avoid making mistakes, even if unsuccessfully.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps his most creative words are those that have three or four syllables and a significant meaning as shortly.
He types the first one, decides it’s incorrect, chooses the second, starts typing it, then realises he’s typing the first
word again and they both mean the same.
</p>
<p>
However, much of this recent performance hasn’t been due to letters and words on their own, rather his struggle
with what he’s trying to write – <italic>hemi hiccups, hemi logjam, hemi communication loss</italic> and <italic>hemi snakes and
ladders</italic> (see main Hemi Story p.p.11). So, in an attempt to compare “then” and “now”, he carried out a simple
exercise, writing the first paragraph of a well known story. Mistakes were down to one for <italic>my right hemi blank
side</italic>, two for <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic>. Probably not much difference from “then”. Not much different from
numbers.
</p>

<h3>Letters and Words - Spoken</h3>
<p>
His spoken word hadn’t been an issue at the time of “the watershed”. However, since then something’s been
going on that fits in with the odd way his mind’s been performing from time to time, and here the frequency has
been increasing, a bit disturbing at times as well.
</p>
<p>
Though there’re two strong contenders for at least part of the responsibility. They may also contribute to his
“watershed based” mistakes, though, if it is the case, it’s only slightly. The first is the trauma of <itlaic>Paradise
Lost 2</itlaic>, leaving him suicidal due to being blamed for a combination of issues for which he’d had no responsibility
– that’s other than having me. While time has passed, the effect and implications will always be with him. The
second is <italic>Paradise Lost 3</italic>, a <italic>hemi story</italic> that will never be told, yet ultimately more disturbing than the other.
</p>
<p>
Without any “watershed involvement”, he’s been lucky again, having another example of “then” and “now”, and
from even further back, all the way to the completion of his communication loss recovery. As earlier, he was
enjoying finding replacements for the three or four words he’d instantly lost after the first word that started what
he wanted to say.
</p>
<p>
Then not long after “the watershed”, he became aware of his reluctance to talk in general conversation, though
while still at work he had no problem as he knew in advance roughly what would be discussed.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere he knew, he knows, what he wants to say, even practices it, yet can’t get the first word out fluently,
soon finding someone else has chipped in, even if it’s something to do with him. It’s disturbing, nothing at all like
the time a fellow student had filled in for him.
</p>
<p>
“Now”, he usually finds himself listening or keeping away to avoid losing his words or appearing standoffish due
to his not saying anything. Meanwhile he’s practicing words to himself, names and key words, wanting to say
“library” and instead comes up with “chemist”, then “dentist”, even “vet”. Sometimes he gets the correct word in
the end, often not.
</p>
<p>
Recently, he tested himself aloud. He goes to the gym every morning – he gave up swimming as he was getting
ever slower, not for fear of another fit - and knows plenty of regulars. They chat, he says “hello” as well, then
listens.
</p>
<p>
Early one morning when it was pouring with rain and the gym was almost empty, he mentioned the weather to
the only regular who’d made it as well. Except instead of saying “rain” his mind came up with “snow”, then “wind”.
When he finally managed “rain”, the word immediately faded away. Fortunately, the regular had already moved
on.
</p>

<h3>Mind Alternatives</h3>
<p>
Finally, his mind’s <italic>hemi variable</italic> mistakes. Here, they make him feel he’s in the baby pool rather than the ocean
storm of the hemi main story.
</p>
<p>
They’re 11 <italic>hemi variable</italic> mistake. There’s no claim to precision or completion, just a sense of what seems to be
going on. Some <italic>hemi variables</italic> are simple, others complex, some frequent, others not, some perhaps better
positioned elsewhere or could be used in more than one setting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks/sounds almost correct:

• almost - always; evolution - evaluation; agitation - gravitation; monument - moment; appreciate –
experience; after – other; words - works
</li>
<li>
Irrelevant:
• impact – seldom; matters – battery; fist – tidy; historical – complementary; original - yesterday;
introduction – question-mark; university – hospital; fate- say
</li>
<li>
Opposites:

• stop – start; first – last; begin – end; important – unconscious; impossible – importance; significant
- slight
</li>
<li>
Having to make several attempts:

• patient, permanent, painful, pavement; reference, referral, reflexion, reflexes
</li>
<li>
Always picks the other of the two:

• what – that; when – then; go – so; does – goes
</li>
<li>
Missing first letter:

• (i)gnoring, (c)apacity, (t)rigger, (a)ttempt, (g)eneral, (a)nything
</li>
<li>
Double letter error – always a delay before understanding:

• disaddear - disappear; refetted – referred; succeffion – succession
</li>
<li>
Mini-scrabble – working out a name in a poster he can’t identify immediately:
• issoa – oasis; Bibraina – Barbican; aworrai - warrior
</li>
<li>
Checking a word, deciding its wrong, coming up with a replacement, starting to type it, realises it’s typing the
original word and finally seeing it again:

• reorganised – rearranged; frightened - afraid; amendment – alteration
</li>
<li>
Comprehension fog:

• three paragraphs in a page, the first and last as usual, the second like a child’s toy with the
shapes of the houses along the street yet without any detail till the fog clears
</li>
<li>
First thing in the morning failure:

• while normally his work’s at its “best” first thing in the morning, periodically it’s at its worst and he
has to start all over again.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Never Ending</h3>
<p>
Time has passed while the <italic>hemi stories</italic> are being put in order, this thanks to two gym regulars who fate
introduced him to out of the blue. And out of the blue as well one recent morning, he realised he’d been talking to
gym regulars he’d never done so before, never more than a nod. And it’s continuing. He isn’t fluent, perhaps due
to <italic>my rewiring hemi companion</italic>, yet certainly something unpleasant has disappeared. He’s no longer hiding his
experience of being called an idiot with learning difficulties.
</p>
<p>
That’s <italic>Paradise Lost 3</italic> and he hopes no <italic>hemi colleague</italic> has experienced, or ever will, something similar. For
him, medical pain is one thing, this pain quite different and more disturbing. It gives him a slight understanding of
what many non-visible disability colleagues experience every day.
