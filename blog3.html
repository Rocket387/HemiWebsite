           <h3> Paradise Lost 3 - <italic>Idiot with Learning Difficulties</italic></h3>
  <p>         
He’d never imagined a <italic>Paradise Lost 3</italic>. Except fate’s put him through so many impossible <italic>hemi
experiences</italic> and, as this one’s among the most disturbing, in the end he’s had no option if he wants the
<italic>hemi stories</italic> to be complete. For years, he’s been called an idiot with learning difficulties due to me and
much else.
</p>
<p>
At first he brushed the abuses aside, the person involved starting life in a horror story that will never do
away. Though in due course he started asking himself what would be the consequences if things
continued as they are.
</p>
<p>
He’s well aware of his own limitations – this comes out as far too polite. Yet he’s also acted from time to
time as a “sort off” therapist, at least always trying to provide support, while the person’s job description
assumes they already know what he was beginning to become aware.
</p>
<p>
Then as he struggled with the <italic>hemi stories</italic>, fate started to play its final game, perhaps even trying to be
helpful, certainly offering him his final chance.
</p>
<p>
He hates seeing jockeys whipping up their horses to force them to go even faster, and this time it was
fate itself playing its own game. He was already questioning whether he’d ever complete the <italic>hemi
stories</italic>, certainly never how they’ve turned out to be.
</p>
<p>
Except instead of feeling good about them after all these years, he’s still trying to pick up the pieces of
what he’s had to learn. What’s mine’s mine and what’s yours is mine as well. And “mine” isn’t him.
